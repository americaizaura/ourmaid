            If you sign an Area Development Agreement (“ADA”) and become an area
            developer, you will pay us the Initial Franchise Fee of $20,000 for
            your first franchise and a development fee (“Development Fee”) based
            on the number of Businesses to be developed. The number of
            Businesses required by the Development Schedule will be determined
            by a number of factors, such as the size of the Development Area,
            the population of the Development Area, and your financial capacity
            and expertise in developing businesses. The Development Fee for each
            Business that you develop will be $10,000. You will be required to
            sign our then-current Franchise Agreement for each Business. The
            Development Fee is paid in a lump sum at the time the ADA is signed,
            is uniform to all developers currently acquiring development rights,
            is not refundable and will not be credited against any other fees
            paid to us or our affiliates. The Development Fee for 3-5 outlets is
            $40,000 - $60,000.
