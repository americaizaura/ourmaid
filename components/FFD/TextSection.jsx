            <p>How to Use This Franchise Disclosure Document</p>

            <p>
              Here are some questions you may be asking about buying a franchise
              and tips on how to find more information:
            </p>

            <p>What You Need To Know About Franchising Generally</p>

            <p>
              Continuing responsibility to pay fees. You may have to pay
              royalties and other fees even if you are losing money. Business
              model can change. The franchise agreement may allow the franchisor
              to change its manuals and business model without your consent.
              These changes may require you to make additional investments in
              your franchise business or may harm your franchise business.
              Supplier restrictions. You may have to buy or lease items from the
              franchisor or a limited group of suppliers the franchisor
              designates. These items may be more expensive than similar items
              you could buy on your own. Operating restrictions. The franchise
              agreement may prohibit you from operating a similar business
              during the term of the franchise. There are usually other
              restrictions. Some examples may include controlling your location,
              your access to customers, what you sell, how you market, and your
              hours of operation. Competition from franchisor. Even if the
              franchise agreement grants you a territory, the franchisor may
              have the right to compete with you in your territory. Renewal.
              Your franchise agreement may not permit you to renew. Even if it
              does, you may have to sign a new agreement with different terms
              and conditions in order to continue to operate your franchise
              business. When your franchise ends. The franchise agreement may
              prohibit you from operating a similar business after your
              franchise ends even if you still have obligations to your landlord
              or other creditors. Some States Require Registration Your state
              may have a franchise law, or other law, that requires franchisors
              to register before offering or selling franchises in the state.
              Registration does not mean that the state recommends the franchise
              or has verified the information in this document. To find out if
              your state has a registration requirement, or to contact your
              state, use the agency information in Exhibit A. Your state also
              may have laws that require special disclosures or amendments be
              made to your franchise agreement. If so, you should check the
              State Specific Addenda. See the Table of Contents for the location
              of the State Specific Addenda.{" "}

            <p>
              Special Risks to Consider About This Franchise Certain states
              require that the following risk(s) be highlighted: 1. Out-of-State
              Dispute Resolution. The franchise agreement requires you to
              resolve disputes with the franchisor by mediation, arbitration
              and/or litigation only in Delaware. Out-of-state mediation,
              arbitration, or litigation may force you to accept a less
              favorable settlement for disputes. It may also cost more to
              mediate, arbitrate, or litigate with the franchisor in Delaware
              than in your own state.
            </p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              2. Short Operating History. The franchisor is at an early stage of
              development and has a limited operating history. This franchise is
              likely to be a riskier investment than a franchise in a system
              with a longer operating history.
            </p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              3. Financial Condition. The Franchisor&rsquo;s financial condition
              as reflected in its financial statements (see Item 21) calls into
              question the Franchisor&rsquo;s financial ability to provide
              services and support to you.
            </p>

            <p>
              Certain states may require other risks to be highlighted. Check
              the &ldquo;State Specific Addenda&rdquo; (if any) to see whether
              your state requires other risks to be highlighted.
            </p>

            <p>MICHIGAN ADDENDUM TO THE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT</p>

            <p>
              THE STATE OF MICHIGAN PROHIBITS CERTAIN UNFAIR PROVISIONS THAT ARE
              SOMETIMES IN FRANCHISE DOCUMENTS. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING
              PROVISIONS ARE IN THESE FRANCHISE DOCUMENTS, THE PROVISIONS ARE
              VOID AND CANNOT BE ENFORCED AGAINST YOU:
            </p>

            <p>
              (a) A prohibition on the right of a franchisee to join an
              association of franchisees.
            </p>

            <p>
              (b) A requirement that a franchisee assent to a release,
              assignment, novation, waiver, or estoppel which deprives a
              franchisee of rights and protections provided in this act. This
              shall not preclude a franchisee, after entering into a franchise
              agreement, from settling any and all claims.
            </p>

            <p>
              (c) A provision that permits a franchisor to terminate a franchise
              prior to the expiration of its term except for good cause. Good
              cause shall include the failure of the franchisee to comply with
              any lawful provision of the franchise agreement and to cure such
              failure after being given written notice thereof and a reasonable
              opportunity, which in no event need be more than 30 days, to cure
              such failure.
            </p>

            <p>
              (d) A provision that permits a franchisor to refuse to renew a
              franchise without fairly compensating the franchisee by repurchase
              or other means for the fair market value at the time of expiration
              of the franchisee&rsquo;s inventory, supplies, equipment,
              fixtures, and furnishings. Personalized materials which have no
              value to the franchisor and inventory, supplies, equipment,
              fixtures, and furnishings not reasonably required in the conduct
              of the franchise business are not subject to compensation. This
              subsection applies only if: (i) The term of the franchise is less
              than 5 years and (ii) the franchisee is prohibited by the
              franchise or other agreement from continuing to conduct
              substantially the same business under another trademark, service
              mark, trade name, logo type, advertising, or other commercial
              symbol in the same area subsequent to the expiration of the
              franchise or the franchisee does not receive at least 6 months
              advance notice of franchisor&rsquo;s intent not to renew the
              franchise.
            </p>

            <p>
              (e) A provision that permits the franchisor to refuse to renew a
              franchise on terms generally available to other franchisees of the
              same class or type under similar circumstances. This section does
              not require a renewal provision.
            </p>

            <p>
              (f) A provision requiring that arbitration or litigation be
              conducted outside this state. This shall not preclude the
              franchisee from entering into an agreement, at the time of
              arbitration, to conduct arbitration at a location outside this
              state.
            </p>

            <p>
              (g) A provision which permits a franchisor to refuse to permit a
              transfer of ownership of a franchise, except for good cause. This
              subdivision does not prevent a franchisor from exercising a right
              of first refusal to purchase the franchise. Good cause shall
              include, but is not limited to: (i) The failure of the proposed
              transferee to meet the franchisor&rsquo;s then current reasonable
              qualifications or standards; (ii) The fact that the proposed
              transferee is a competitor of the franchisor or subfranchisor;
              (iii) The unwillingness of the proposed transferee to agree in
              writing to comply with all lawful obligations; (iv) The failure of
              the franchisee or proposed transferee to pay any sums owing to the
              franchisor or to cure any default in the franchise agreement
              existing at the time of the proposed transfer.
            </p>

            <p>
              (h) A provision that requires the franchisee to resell to the
              franchisor items that are not uniquely identified with the
              franchisor. This subdivision does not prohibit a provision that
              grants to a franchisor a right of first refusal to purchase the
              assets of a franchise on the same terms and conditions as a bona
              fide third party willing and able to purchase those assets, nor
              does this subdivision prohibit a provision that grants the
              franchisor the right to acquire the assets of a franchise for the
              market or appraised value of such assets if the franchisee has
              breached the lawful provisions of the franchise agreement and has
              failed to cure the breach in the manner provided in subdivision
              (c).
            </p>

            <p>
              (i) A provision which permits the franchisor to directly or
              indirectly convey, assign, or otherwise transfer its obligation to
              fulfill contractual obligations to the franchisee unless provision
              has been made for providing the required contractual services.

            <p>Affiliates.</p>

            <p>
              We had an Affiliate, Antonio Moreno Enterprises, Inc., a Texas
              corporation formed on May 11, 2000, with a principal business
              address of 500 E. Arapaho Road, Suite 503, Richardson, TX 75081,

              disclosure document from May 2000 until February 2020.
            </p>

            <p>
              Then in February 2020, the outlet was transferred to Our Maids,
              Inc., a Delaware corporation formed on February 5, 2020, with a
              principal business address of 8 The Green, Suite A, Dover DE
              19901, which operates the following outlets similar to the one
              offered through this disclosure document:
            </p>

            <p>
              The Affiliate has not offered franchises in this line or any other
              line of business and does not provide products or services to
              franchisees.
            </p>

            <p>The Franchise Offered.</p>

              We offer franchises for a business offering residential and
              commercial cleaning services under the trademark and trade name
              Our Maids.

            <p>
              We also offer, to qualified individuals, the right to operate
              multiple Franchised Businesses, typically three to five, per an

              the Area Development Agreement. You must sign then current future
              franchise agreements which may differ from the form of franchise
              agreement included in this franchise disclosure document. We base

            </p>

            <p>
              Your franchised business may have to compete with other businesses
              offering services and products similar to those that you will
              offer, including franchised operations, national chains, and other
              independently owned companies.

              You must pay us, upon signing the franchise agreement, a $20,000
              initial franchise fee (&ldquo;Initial Franchise Fee&rdquo;).
            </p>

            <p>Area Development Program</p>

            <p>
              If you sign an Area Development Agreement (&ldquo;ADA&rdquo;) and
              become an area developer, you will pay us the Initial Franchise
              Fee of $20,000 for your first franchise and a development fee
              (&ldquo;Development Fee&rdquo;) based on the number of Businesses
              to be developed. The number of Businesses required by the
              Development Schedule will be determined by a number of factors,
              such as the size of the Development Area, the population of the
              Development Area, and your financial capacity and expertise in
              developing businesses. The Development Fee for each Business that
              you develop will be $10,000. You will be required to sign our
              then-current Franchise Agreement for each Business. The
              Development Fee is paid in a lump sum at the time the ADA is
              signed, is uniform to all developers currently acquiring
              development rights, is not refundable and will not be credited
              against any other fees paid to us or our affiliates. The
              Development Fee for 3-5 outlets is $40,000 - $60,000.
            </p>

            <p>Refundability of Initial Fees.</p>

            <p>
              The initial fees discussed above are uniformly imposed, are fully
              earned when the franchise agreement is signed, and are
              non-refundable.

            <p>B. AREA DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT</p>

            <p></p>

            <p>
              Note 1- The low-end comprises of the initial franchise fee of
              $20,000 plus the $20,000 for the additional two outlets ($10,000 x
              2). The high-end comprises of the initial franchise fee of $20,000
              plus the $50,000 for the additional four outlets ($10,000 x 4).
            </p>

            <p>
              Note 2-The low-end comprises of the low-end estimate from the Item
              7.A table, less the $20,000 initial franchise fee, as it is
              included in the Area Development Fee ($42,500 - $20,000 =
              $22,500). The high-end comprises of the high-end estimate from the
              Item 7.A table, less the $20,000 initial franchise fee, as it is
              included in the Area Development Fee ($55,250 - $20,000 =
              $35,250).
            </p>

            <p>
              The estimates in this Chart 7(B) assume that you will be entering
              into an Area Development Agreement for the right to open and
              operate three to five Franchised Businesses within a Development
              Area and the cost of opening the first Franchised Business.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Area Development Fee ranges from $40,000 to $60,000 for three
              to five territories, as explained in Item 5 above. The Area
              Development Fee includes the Initial Franchise Fee on the first
              territory purchased under the Development Agreement and one-half
              the Initial Franchise Fee on additional territories. You pay the
              remaining one-half of the Initial Franchise Fee on additional
              territories at the time you enter into Franchise Agreements for
              such territories.
            </p>

            <p>
              This figure represents the total estimated initial investment
              required to open your initial Franchised Business under the
              Franchise Agreement you must enter into with us at the same time
              as the execution of your Development Agreement.
            </p>

            <p>
              Other than the Development Fee, this figure does not include the
              costs associated with opening a second and subsequent locations
              which will incur additional costs.
            </p>

            </p>

            <p>Officer Interests in Suppliers:</p>

            <p>Our officer, Antonio Moreno, owns an interest in us.</p>

            <p>Alternative Suppliers:</p>

            <p>
              We do not maintain written criteria for approving suppliers and
              thus these criteria are not available to you or your proposed
              supplier. We do permit you to contract with alternative suppliers
              if approved by us and they meet our criteria. We charge any costs
              incurred, up to $1,000, to test another supplier that you propose.
              If you wish to propose to us another supplier, you may submit the
              proposed supplier that you wish for us to consider in writing.
              Your request must include sufficient specifications, photographs,
              drawings and other information and samples to enable us to
              determine whether supplier meets our specifications. Your request
              must also provide confirmation that the supplier is financially
              sound and carries adequate liability insurance. We will examine
              the quality of the items and the supplier&rsquo;s ability to
              supply a sufficient quantity in a timely way with good customer
              service to determine whether to consider adding the supplier to
              our list of approved vendors. We will notify you within 30 days if
              we approve or disapprove of an alternative supplier. If we revoke
              approval for a supplier, we will provide written notice to you.
            </p>

            <p>Issuance and Modification of Specifications:</p>

            <p>
              We issue specifications and standards to franchisees or approved
              suppliers through our Operations Manual or through informational
              bulletins we issue from time to time.
            </p>

            <p>Revenue from Required Purchases:</p>

            <p>
              We may, but do not currently, derive revenue or other material
              consideration from required purchases or leases by you. Our
              affiliate does not earn revenue or other material consideration
              from required franchisee purchases or leases.
            </p>

            <p>
              In our last fiscal year ending December 31, 2022, we did not earn
              revenue or other material consideration from required purchases or
              leases by franchisees.
            </p>

            <p>Required Purchases as a Proportion of Costs:</p>

            <p>
              We estimate that approximately 70% of your expenditures for leases
              and purchases in establishing your Franchised Business will be for
              goods and services that must be purchased from us, an Affiliate,
              an approved supplier, or from another party according to our
              standards and specifications. We estimate that approximately 30%
              of your expenditures on an ongoing basis will be for goods and
              services that must be purchased either from us, an Affiliate, an
              approved supplier or another party according to our standards and
              specifications.
            </p>

            <p>Supplier Payments to Us:</p>

            <p>
              Designated suppliers may make payments to us from franchisee
              purchases.
            </p>

            <p>

              We estimate that the typical length of time between the signing of
              the Franchise Agreement and the opening of the franchise is
              approximately 10-30 days. Factors that may affect your beginning
              operations include the ability to secure permits, obtain
              equipment, and hire and train employees. You must open your
              franchised business and be operational within 60 days from
              executing the Franchise Agreement. Nonetheless, we reserve the
              right to grant extensions to the Time Before Operations period at

            <p>ITEM 12. TERRITORY</p>

            <p>
              The territory will be for a specific geographic region that we
              define and approve by radius, zip codes, natural, or political
              boundaries as set forth in the Franchise Agreement.
            </p>

            <p>
              A territory will normally include an area of 200,000 households.
            </p>

            <p>
              We would not normally have occasion to approve relocation of the
              franchised business because you will work from your home and a
              vehicle.
            </p>

            <p>
              We would not normally grant to you approval to open an additional
              outlet within your territory, but may grant you additional
              franchise territories if we feel you have the time, energy,
              capital, and management structure to be able to successfully open
              and operate another territory.
            </p>

            <p>
              We do not grant you options, rights of first refusal, or similar
              rights to acquire additional franchises.
            </p>

            <p>
              You will receive an exclusive territory, meaning a geographic area
              within which we promise not to establish either a company-owned or
              franchised outlet selling the same or similar goods or services
              under the same or similar trademarks or service marks.
            </p>

            <p>
              Continuation of your territorial rights does not depend on
              achieving a certain sales volume, market penetration, or other
              contingency, and we may not alter your franchise territory, even
              if there is a population increase in your territory.
            </p>

            <p>
              We or an affiliate reserves the right to use other channels of
              distribution, such as the Internet, catalog sales, telemarketing,
              or other direct marketing sales, to solicit or accept orders
              within your territory using our principal trademarks, however, we
              would normally direct inquiries for services from within your
              territory to your outlet.
            </p>

            <p>
              We or an affiliate also reserves the right to use other channels
              of distribution, such as the Internet, catalog sales,
              telemarketing, or other direct marketing sales, to make sales
              within your territory of products or services under trademarks
              different from the ones that you will use under the franchise
              agreement.
            </p>

            <p>
              We are not obligated to pay compensation to you for soliciting or
              accepting orders from inside your territory.
            </p>

            <p>
              You and other franchisees may not solicit (but may accept) orders
              from consumers outside of your territory, including through the
              use of other channels of distribution, such as the Internet,
              catalog sales, telemarketing, or other direct marketing, but you
              may engage in internet and social media marketing pursuant to our
              guidelines which such marketing may extend outside your territory.
              We also reserve the right to implement cross-territorial protocols
              and other guidelines applicable to such situations as group
              advertising buys by multiple franchisees which may extend into
              multiple territories, solicitation of orders of individuals who
              may reside in one territory, yet work in another, and other
              cross-territorial situations. You agree to abide by any such
              cross-territorial protocols.
            </p>

            <p>
              Neither we nor an affiliate operates, franchises, or has plans to

              {" "}
              Under the Area Development Agreement (the &ldquo;ADA&rdquo;), you
              will develop, open and operate multiple outlets within a defined
              Development Area (the &ldquo;Development Area&rdquo;). We

            <p>ITEM 13. TRADEMARKS</p>

            <p>
              The franchise agreement licenses to you the right to use the
              following principal trademarks (&ldquo;Marks&rdquo;) registered or
              applied for with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
              (&ldquo;USPTO&rdquo;):
            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>
             We do not have a federal registration for our principal trademark. SERIAL/ REGISTRATION NO. 7036264: PRINCIPAL REGISTER: REGISTRATION DATE, APRIL 25, 2023.
            </p>

            <p>
              There are no currently effective agreements that significantly
              limit our rights to use or license the use of our trademarks
              listed in this section.
            </p>

            <p>
              There are no currently effective determinations of the USPTO, the
              Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, or any state trademark
              administrator or any court; or any pending infringement,
              opposition, or cancellation proceeding in which we unsuccessfully
              sought to prevent registration of a trademark in order to protect
              a trademark licensed by the franchisor. There is no pending
              material federal or state court litigation regarding our use or
              ownership rights in a trademark.
            </p>

            <p>
              We know of no infringing or prior superior uses that could
              materially affect the use of the Marks.
            </p>

            <p>
              You do not receive any rights to the Marks other than the right to
              use them in the operation of your Franchised Business. You must
              follow our rules when you use the Marks. You must use the Marks as
              the sole trade identification of the franchised business. You
              cannot use any Mark or portion of any Mark as part of any business
              entity name. You may not use any Mark in connection with the sale
              of any unauthorized services or products, or in any other manner
              that we do not authorize in writing. You must obtain a fictitious
              or assumed name registration if required by your state or local
              law. Any unauthorized use of the Marks by you is a breach of the
              Franchise Agreement and an infringement of our rights in the
              Marks. You must not contest the validity or ownership of the
              Marks, including any Marks that we license to you after you sign
              the Franchise Agreement. You must not assist any other person in
              contesting the validity or ownership of the Marks.
            </p>

            <p>
              You must immediately notify us in writing when you learn about any
              claim of infringement, unfair competition, or similar claims about
              the Marks. You must not communicate with any person other than us
              and our counsel regarding any infringements, challenges or claims
              unless you are legally required to do so. However, you may
              communicate with your own counsel at your own expense. We are not
              required to take affirmative action when notified of these uses or
              claims. We have the sole right to control any administrative or
              judicial proceeding involving a trademark licensed by us. The
              Franchise Agreement does not require us to participate in your
              defense or indemnify you for expenses or damages if you are a
              party to an administrative or judicial proceeding involving a
              trademark licensed by us to you or if the proceeding is resolved
              unfavorable to you. You must take any actions that, in the opinion
              of our counsel, may be advisable to protect and maintain our
              interests in any proceeding or to otherwise protect and maintain
              our interests in the Marks.
            </p>

            <p>
              If we require, you must modify or discontinue the use of any Mark
              and use other trademarks or service marks we designate. We do not
              have to reimburse you for modifying or discontinuing the use of a
              Mark or for substituting another trademark or service mark for a
              discontinued Mark. If we adopt and use new or modified Marks, you
              must add or replace equipment, supplies and fixtures, and you must
              make other modifications we designate as necessary to adapt your
              franchised business for the new or modified Marks. We do not
              reimburse you for any loss of goodwill associated with a modified
              or discontinued Mark.
            </p>

            <p>
              You must notify us if you apply for your own trademark or service
              mark registrations. You must not register or seek to register as a
              trademark or service mark, either with the USPTO or any state or
              foreign country, any of the Marks or a trademark or service mark
              that is confusingly similar to any of our Marks.

            <p>
              We do not have an obligation to protect the copyrights or to
              defend you against claims arising from your use of the copyrighted
              items. You must notify us if any claim for copyright infringement
              is brought against you over materials in which we claim a
              copyright. We have the right to control litigation over our
              copyrights. We are not required to participate in your defense or
              indemnify you for expenses and damages in a proceeding involving a
              copyright licensed to you. Your rights in the franchise agreement
              would continue if we require you to modify or discontinue using
              the subject matter covered by the copyright.
            </p>

            <p>
              We know of no effective determinations of the U.S. Copyright
              Office or any court regarding any of our copyrighted materials.
              Our right to use or license copyrighted items is not materially
              limited by any agreement or known infringing use.

              in the Operations Manual and as a result of the assistance we
              furnish you during the term of the franchise. You may only use the
              trade secrets and other confidential information for the purpose
              of operating your Franchised Business. You may only divulge trade
              secrets and/or other confidential information to employees who
              must have access to it to operate the Franchised Business. You are
              responsible for enforcing the confidentiality provisions as to
              your employees.

              attached to the Franchise Agreement. We will be a third-party

              Your use of the Operations Manual, trade secrets or other

            </p>

            <p>
              Either the Franchisee or its on-site Designated Manager must
              devote sufficient efforts to the management of the day-to-day
              operations of the Franchised Business, but not less than forty
              (40) hours per week. While you have the right to select any
              Designated Manager, we retain the right to accept or reject any
              proposed individual or entity as the Designated Manager. You will
              be responsible for the compensation to any individual or entity
              you contract to act as the Designated Manager of the Business. You
              have the sole legal responsibility for any dispute relating to
              such individual or entity. We maintain the right to require any
              approved Designated Manager to attend and satisfactorily complete
              our initial training program before opening the Business. You must
              keep us informed at all times of the identity of your Designated
              Manager. If you must replace the Designated Manager, your
              replacement Manager must be approved by us within 60 days, such
              approval not to be unreasonably withheld &ndash; we may
              additionally require such replacement Designated Manager to attend
              and complete our training program at your expense. If the
              Franchisee is an entity, its Designated Manager is not required to
              own an equity interest in the Franchisee.
            </p>

              As described in ITEM 14, certain individuals associated with your
              Franchised Business, including your owners, officers, directors,
              partners, and your managers, executives, employees, and staff may
              be required to sign nondisclosure and non-competition agreements
              the same as or similar to the Nondisclosure and Non-Competition
              Agreement attached to the Franchise Agreement. We will be a

              Agreement and agree to be personally liable for your breach of the

            <p>ITEM 16. RESTRICTIONS ON WHAT THE FRANCHISEE MAY SELL</p>

            <p>
              You must offer and sell all the services and products we specify.
              You may not sell any services or products that we have not
              authorized and you must discontinue offering any services or
              products that we may disapprove of. We may take action, including
              terminating your franchise if you purchase or sell unapproved
              products or make purchases from unapproved suppliers. We may
              periodically change required or authorized services or products.
              There are no limits on our right to do so, except that your
              investment required to change required or authorized products or
              services will not be unreasonably disproportionate to your initial
              investment.
            </p>

            <p>
              Periodically, we may allow certain services or products that are
              not otherwise authorized for general use as a part of the System
              to be offered locally or regionally based on factors, including
              test marketing, your qualifications, and regional or local
              differences.

            <p>ITEM 19. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE REPRESENTATIONS</p>

            <p>
              The FTC&rsquo;s Franchise Rule permits a franchisor to provide
              information about the actual or potential financial performance of
              its franchised and/or franchisor-owned outlets, if there is a
              reasonable basis for the information, and if the information is
              included in the Disclosure Document. Financial performance
              information that differs from that included in Item 19 may be
              given only if: (1) a franchisor provides the actual records of an
              existing outlet you are considering buying; or (2) a franchisor
              supplements the information provided in this Item 19, for example,
              by providing information about possible performance at a
              particular franchised location or under particular circumstances.
            </p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              We do not make any financial performance representations. We also
              do not authorize our employees or representatives to make any such
              representations either orally or in writing. If you are purchasing
              an existing outlet, however, we may provide you with the actual
              records of that outlet. If you receive any other financial
              performance information or projections of your future income, you
              should report it to the franchisor&rsquo;s management by
              contacting Antonio Moreno, 8 The Green, Suite 14095, Dover, DE
              19901; 302-389-5221; the Federal Trade Commission; and the
              appropriate state regulatory agencies.

              during our most recently completed fiscal year or who have not
              communicated with us within 10 weeks of the Issuance Date of this
              Disclosure Document. If you buy this franchise, your contact
              information may be disclosed to other buyers when you leave the
              franchise system.

              franchise system.

              operating a franchise outside of the Territory without the prior
              written consent of Franchisor.
            </p>

            <p>
              We would not normally have occasion to approve relocation of the
              franchised business because you will work from your home and a
              vehicle.
            </p>

            <p>
              We would not normally grant to you approval to open an additional
              outlet within your territory, but may grant you additional
              franchise territories if we feel you have the time, energy,
              capital, and management structure to be able to successfully open
              and operate another territory.
            </p>

            <p>
              We do not grant you options, rights of first refusal, or similar
              rights to acquire additional franchises.
            </p>

            <p>
              You will receive an exclusive territory, meaning a geographic area
              within which we promise not to establish either a company-owned or
              franchised outlet selling the same or similar goods or services
              under the same or similar trademarks or service marks.
            </p>

            <p>
              Continuation of your territorial rights does not depend on
              achieving a certain sales volume, market penetration, or other
              contingency, and we may not alter your franchise territory, even
              if there is a population increase in your territory.
            </p>

            <p>
              We or an affiliate reserves the right to use other channels of
              distribution, such as the Internet, catalog sales, telemarketing,
              or other direct marketing sales, to solicit or accept orders
              within your territory using our principal trademarks, however, we
              would normally direct inquiries for services from within your
              territory to your outlet.
            </p>

            <p>
              We or an affiliate also reserves the right to use other channels
              of distribution, such as the Internet, catalog sales,
              telemarketing, or other direct marketing sales, to make sales
              within your territory of products or services under trademarks
              different from the ones that you will use under the franchise
              agreement.
            </p>

            <p>
              We are not obligated to pay compensation to you for soliciting or
              accepting orders from inside your territory.
            </p>

            <p>
              You and other franchisees may not solicit (but may accept) orders
              from consumers outside of your territory, including through the
              use of other channels of distribution, such as the Internet,
              catalog sales, telemarketing, or other direct marketing, but you
              may engage in internet and social media marketing pursuant to our
              guidelines which such marketing may extend outside your territory.
              We also reserve the right to implement cross-territorial protocols
              and other guidelines applicable to such situations as group
              advertising buys by multiple franchisees which may extend into
              multiple territories, solicitation of orders of individuals who
              may reside in one territory, yet work in another, and other
              cross-territorial situations. You agree to abide by any such
              cross-territorial protocols.
            </p>

            <p>
              Neither we nor an affiliate operates, franchises, or has plans to
              operate or franchise a business under a different trademark which
              such business sells or will sell goods or services similar to
              those you will offer, but we reserve the right to do so.

              Agreement and is non-refundable. The Franchise Fee is payment, in
              part, for expenses incurred by Franchisor in furnishing assistance
              and services to Franchisee as in this Agreement and for costs
              incurred by Franchisor, including general sales and marketing

              Business is open for operation and continues for the duration the

              a Gross Revenues Report, as required by Section 12.2, for each
              month during the operation of the Franchise. If Franchisor
              requires Franchisee to pay Royalty Fees through electronic
              transfer as in Section 3.4, such reports shall instead be
              submitted to Franchisor via facsimile transmission, e-mail or

              Account (&ldquo;EDTA&rdquo;). At Franchisor&rsquo;s request,
              Franchisee shall open and maintain an EDTA, and shall provide
              Franchisor with continuous access to such account for the purpose
              of receiving any payments due to Franchisor. Franchisee shall make
              deposits to the account sufficient to cover amounts owed to
              Franchisor prior to the date such amounts are due. Franchisee
              shall execute any documents Franchisor&rsquo;s or
              Franchisee&rsquo;s bank requires to establish and implement the

              unpaid and past due amounts due Franchisor, including reasonable
              accounting and legal fees. This Section shall not constitute an
              agreement by Franchisor to accept any payments after the due date
              or a commitment by Franchisor to extend credit to or otherwise
              finance Franchisee.

              insurance coverage and payment of premiums as Franchisor may
              request;
            </p>

            <p>complete initial training to the satisfaction of Franchisor;</p>

            <p>
              possess all required state, county, city, and local professional

            </p>

            <p>pay in full all amounts due to Franchisor;</p>

            <p>
              if Franchisee is a business entity, Franchisee has caused each of

              form satisfactory to Franchisor that such ownership interest is
              held subject to, and that further assignment or transfer thereof
              is subject to, all restrictions imposed upon transfers and
              assignments by this Agreement; and

            <p>
              obtain Franchisor&rsquo;s permission and approval of an opening
              date; Franchisor shall not unreasonably withhold consent to open.
              Permission to open shall be based on Franchisor&rsquo;s
              determination that Franchisee is ready to open and satisfactorily
              prepared to operate.
            </p>

            <p>5.4 Failure to Open</p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              Should Franchisee fail to commence operations of the Franchised
              Business within 60 days after the Effective Date, Franchisor has
              the right to terminate this Agreement. If this Agreement is
              terminated according to this Section 5.4, Franchisor shall retain
              the entire Franchise Fee paid by Franchisee. The Franchise Fee
              retained shall be specifically understood and agreed by the

              expended, work performed, and other efforts of Franchisor up to
              the date of Franchisee&rsquo;s failure to timely commence
              operations of the Franchised Business and shall not be construed
              as nor considered to be a penalty.

            <p>6.1 Ownership</p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              Franchisee&rsquo;s right to use the Marks is derived solely from
              this Agreement, is exclusive and is limited to the conduct of
              business by Franchisee according to, and in compliance with, this
              Agreement and all applicable standards, specifications and
              operating procedures prescribed from time to time by Franchisor.
              Any unauthorized use of the Marks by Franchisee is a breach of
              this Agreement and an infringement of the rights of Franchisor in
              and to the Marks. Franchisee&rsquo;s use of the Marks, and any
              goodwill created thereby, shall inure to the benefit of
              Franchisor. Franchisee shall not at any time acquire an ownership
              interest in the Marks by virtue of any use it may make of the
              Marks. This Agreement does not confer any goodwill, title or
              interest in the Marks to Franchisee. Franchisee shall not, at any
              time during the term of this Agreement or after its termination or
              expiration, contest the validity or ownership of any of the Marks
              or assist any other person in contesting the validity or ownership
              of any of the Marks.

            <p>
              6.2 Limitations on Use Franchisee shall not use any Mark or
              portion of any Mark as part of any business entity name.
              Franchisee shall not use any Mark in connection with the sale of
              any unauthorized product or service or in any other manner not
              expressly authorized in writing by Franchisor. Franchisee shall
              give such notices of trademark and service mark registrations as
              Franchisor specifies and obtain such fictitious or assumed name
              registrations as may be required under applicable law to do
              business as a Franchised Business. Franchisee shall not register
              or seek to register as a trademark or service mark, either with
              the United States Patent and Trademark Office or any state or
              foreign country, any of the Marks or a trademark or service mark
              that is confusingly similar to any Mark licensed to Franchisee.
              Franchisee shall include on its letterhead, forms, cards and other
              such identification, a prominent notice stating that the
              Franchised Business is an &ldquo;Independently Owned and Operated
              Our Maids Franchise&rdquo; of Franchisee.
            </p>

            <p>6.3 Notification of Infringements and Claims</p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              Franchisee shall immediately notify Franchisor in writing of any
              infringement, claim of infringement, unfair competition, or
              challenge to its use of any of the Marks or claim by any person of
              any rights in any of the Marks. Franchisee shall not communicate
              with any person other than Franchisor and Franchisor&rsquo;s
              counsel in connection with any such infringement, challenge, or
              claim. However, Franchisee may communicate with Franchisee&rsquo;s
              counsel at Franchisee&rsquo;s expense. We are not required to take
              affirmative action when notified of these uses or claims. We have
              the sole right to control any administrative or judicial
              proceeding involving a trademark licensed by us. The Franchise
              Agreement does not require us to participate in your defense or
              indemnify you for expenses or damages if you are a party to an
              administrative or judicial proceeding involving a trademark
              licensed by us to you or if the proceeding is resolved unfavorable
              to you. Franchisee shall execute any and all instruments and
              documents, render such assistance, and do such acts and things as
              may, in the opinion of Franchisor&rsquo;s counsel, be necessary or
              advisable to protect and maintain Franchisor&rsquo;s interests in
              any such litigation or other proceeding or to otherwise protect
              and maintain Franchisor&rsquo;s interest in the Marks.

              indemnify you for expenses or damages if you are a party to an
              administrative or judicial proceeding involving a trademark. At
              Franchisor&rsquo;s option, Franchisor or its designee may defend
              and control the defense of any proceeding arising directly from
              Franchisee&rsquo;s use of any Mark.
            </p>

              discontinue use of any of the Marks, and/or use one (1) or more
              additional or substitute trade names, trademarks, service marks or
              other commercial symbols, Franchisee shall comply with
              Franchisor&rsquo;s directions within ten (10) business days after
              notice to Franchisee by Franchisor and subject to the limitations
              in Section 10.2. Franchisor shall not be required to reimburse
              Franchisee for its expenses in modifying or discontinuing the use
              of a Mark or any loss of goodwill associated with any modified or
              discontinued Mark or for any expenditures made by Franchisee to
              promote a modified or substitute Mark.

              or uniform resource locator containing the Marks or any variation
              thereof without Franchisor&rsquo;s written approval. Franchisor is
              the sole owner of a right, title, and interest in and to such
              domain names. Franchisor will provide contact information for your
              Franchised Business on its website. We will provide to you a

              Secrets or other Confidential Information in any other business
              venture would constitute an unfair method of competition.
              Franchisee acknowledges that the Trade Secrets and other
              Confidential Information are proprietary and are disclosed to
              Franchisee solely on the condition that Franchisee (and all

              employees, agents and representatives and shall be liable to
              Franchisor for any unauthorized disclosure or use of Trade Secrets
              or other Confidential Information by any of them.

              hereby agrees to assign to Franchisor all right, title and

              any item does not qualify as a &ldquo;work made-for-hire&rdquo;

            <p>10. FRANCHISE SYSTEM</p>

            <p>10.1 Uniformity</p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              Franchisee shall strictly comply, and shall cause the Franchised
              Business and its employees to strictly comply, with all
              requirements, specifications, standards, operating procedures and
              rules in this Agreement, the Operations Manual or other
              communications supplied to Franchisee by Franchisor.
            </p>

            <p>10.2 Modification of the System</p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              Franchisee recognizes that from time to time, Franchisor may
              introduce, as part of the System, other methods or technology
              which require certain System modifications including, without
              limitation, the adoption and use of modified or substitute Marks,
              new computer hardware and software, equipment or signs. Franchisee
              agrees to make all required upgrades and modifications at its
              expense as may be required by Franchisor; provided, however, that
              Franchisee shall not be required to make any expenditures during
              the first year of the initial term or any expenditures which are
              unreasonably disproportionate to Franchisee&rsquo;s initial
              investment to establish the Franchised Business during the initial
              term. If such additional investment is required to be made in the
              last year of the initial term, Franchisee may avoid making the
              investment by providing notice of intent not to renew the
              Franchise unless the investment is in connection with a
              modification to the System required by law or court order.
              Franchisee acknowledges that any required expenditures for changes
              or upgrades to the System shall be in addition to expenditures for
              repairs and maintenance as required in Section 13.2 of this
              Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Franchisee shall be
              required to make any and all improvements or modifications
              whenever such are required by law, regulation, agency decision or
              court order.

              {" "}
              Franchisor has the right to vary standards or specifications for
              any franchisee based upon that particular franchisee&rsquo;s
              qualifications, the peculiarities of the particular site or
              circumstances, the demographics of the trade area, business
              potential, existing business practices or any other condition
              which Franchisor deems to be of importance to the successful
              operation of any particular Our Maids Business. Franchisor shall
              not be required to disclose or grant to Franchisee a like or
              similar variance hereunder.

              not authorized for general use as part of the System. Such consent
              will be based upon the factors in Section 10.4 and shall not

              {" "}
              13.1.5 Franchisor shall provide Franchisee, in the Operations
              Manual or other written or electronic form, with a list of
              specifications and, if required, a list of Approved Suppliers for
              some or all of the supplies, furniture, fixtures, inventory,
              equipment and other approved or specified items and services, and
              Franchisor may from time to time issue revisions to such list. If
              Franchisor or an Affiliate is an Approved Supplier, Franchisee
              shall execute a standard form purchase or supply agreement for the
              items to be supplied by Franchisor or its Affiliate. If Franchisee
              desires to utilize any products, services or new technology that
              Franchisor has not approved (for products and services that

              sufficient information, specifications and samples for Franchisor
              to determine whether the service or product complies with its
              standards and specifications or whether the supplier meets its
              Approved Supplier criteria. Franchisee shall bear all expenses
              incurred by Franchisor in connection with determining whether it
              shall approve an item, service or supplier, not to exceed

              (usually thirty [30] days) after receiving the required
              information whether Franchisee may purchase or lease such items or
              services or from such supplier. Approval of a supplier may be
              conditioned on the supplier&rsquo;s ability to provide sufficient
              quantity of product; quality of products or services at
              competitive prices; production and delivery capability; and
              dependability and general reputation. Nothing in this Section
              shall be construed to require Franchisor to approve any particular
              supplier, or to require Franchisor to make available to
              prospective suppliers, standards and specifications that
              Franchisor deems confidential.

              did not fairly handle a customer complaint or has operated outside
              of applicable rules and regulations, Franchisor has the right to
              intervene and satisfy the customer. Franchisor has the right to
              terminate this Agreement for violation of this Section. Franchisee

              workers&rsquo; compensation insurance) shall expressly name
              Franchisor as an additional insured or loss payee and all shall
              contain a waiver of all subrogation rights against Franchisor and
              its successors and assigns.
            </p>

            <p>15.2 Future Increases</p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              Franchisor has the right to reasonably increase the minimum
              liability protection requirement annually and require different or
              additional insurance coverage(s) to reflect inflation, changes in
              standards of liability, future damage awards, or other relevant
              changes in circumstances.
            </p>

            <p>15.3 Carrier Standards</p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              Such policies shall be written by an insurance company licensed in
              the state in which Franchisee operates and having at least an
              &ldquo;A&rdquo; Rating Classification as indicated in the latest
              issue of A.M. Best&rsquo;s Key Rating Guide. Although A.M. Best
              groups &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;A-&rdquo; in the same
              classification, Franchisor demands an &ldquo;A&rdquo; rating.
            </p>

            <p>15.4 Evidence of Coverage</p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              Franchisee&rsquo;s obligation to obtain and maintain the foregoing
              policies shall not be limited in any way by reason of any
              insurance which may be maintained by Franchisor, nor shall
              Franchisee&rsquo;s performance of this obligation relieve it of
              liability under the indemnity provisions in Section 21.3. Upon
              issuance of a policy and renewal of said policy, Franchisee shall
              provide to Franchisor, certificates of insurance showing
              compliance with the foregoing requirements within fifteen (15)
              days of Franchisee&rsquo;s receipt of such certificates. Such
              certificates shall state that said policy or policies shall not be
              canceled or altered without at least thirty (30) days&rsquo; prior
              written notice to Franchisor and shall reflect proof of payment of
              premiums.
            </p>

            <p>15.5 Failure to Maintain Coverage</p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              Should Franchisee not procure and maintain insurance coverage as
              required by this Agreement, Franchisor has the right (but not the
              obligation) to immediately procure such insurance coverage and to
              charge the premiums to Franchisee, which charges, together with a
              reasonable fee for expenses incurred by Franchisor in connection
              with such procurement, shall be payable by Franchisee immediately
              upon notice.

              removal of all physical and structural features identifying or

              right to set off all amounts due from Franchisee under this
              Agreement, if any, against the purchase price.

            <p>18.2 Transfer by Franchisee to a Third Party</p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              The rights and duties of Franchisee as in this Agreement, and the
              Franchise herein granted, are personal to Franchisee (or its
              owners), and Franchisor has entered into this Agreement in
              reliance upon Franchisee&rsquo;s personal or collective skill and
              financial ability. Accordingly, neither Franchisee nor any holder
              of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisee may sell, assign,
              convey, give away, pledge, mortgage, sublicense or otherwise
              transfer, whether by operation of law or otherwise, any interest
              in this Agreement, the Franchise granted hereby, the assets of the
              Franchised Business or any part or all of the ownership interest
              in Franchisee without the prior written approval of Franchisor.
              Any purported transfer without such approval shall be null and
              void and shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement. If
              Franchisee is in compliance with this Agreement,
              Franchisor&rsquo;s consent to such transfer shall be conditioned
              upon the satisfaction of the following requirements:
            </p>

            <p>Franchisee has complied with the requirements in Section 19;</p>

            <p>
              all obligations owed to Franchisor, and all other outstanding
              obligations relating to the Franchised Business, are fully paid
              and satisfied;
            </p>

            <p>
              Franchisee (and any transferring owners, if Franchisee is a
              business entity) has executed a general release, in a form the
              same as or similar to the General Release attached as Schedule 1,
              of any and all claims against Franchisor, including its officers,
              directors, shareholders, managers, members, partners, owners,
              employees and agents (in their corporate and individual
              capacities), including, without limitation, claims arising under
              federal, state or local laws, rules or ordinances, and any other
              matters incident to the termination of this Agreement or to the
              transfer of Franchisee&rsquo;s interest herein or to the transfer
              of Franchisee&rsquo;s ownership of all or any part of the
              Franchise; provided, however, that if a general release is
              prohibited, Franchisee shall give the maximum release allowed by
              law;
            </p>

            <p>
              the prospective transferee has satisfied Franchisor that it meets
              Franchisor&rsquo;s management, business and financial standards,

              substantially different from this Agreement, including different
              Royalty Fee and other material provisions, and the franchise
              agreement then executed shall be for the term specified in such
              agreement;
            </p>

            <p>
              the transferee has executed a general release, in a form the same
              as or similar to the General Release attached as Schedule 1, of

              Franchisee has provided Franchisor with a complete copy of all
              contracts and agreements and related documentation between
              Franchisee and the prospective transferee relating to the intended
              sale or transfer of the Franchise;
            </p>

            <p>
              Franchisee, or the transferee, has paid to Franchisor, before the
              transaction is completed, a transfer fee in the amount of 25% of
              the then current initial franchise fee;
            </p>

            <p>
              the transferee, or all holders of a legal or beneficial interest
              in the transferee, has agreed to be personally bound jointly and
              severally by all provisions of this Agreement for the remainder of
              its term by executing a personal guaranty in such form as prepared
              by Franchisor;
            </p>

            <p>
              the transferee has obtained all necessary consents and approvals
              by third parties and all applicable federal, state, and local
              laws, rules, ordinances, and requirements applicable to the
              transfer have been complied with or satisfied;
            </p>

            <p>
              Franchisee has, and if Franchisee is an entity, all of the holders
              of a legal and beneficial interest in Franchisee have executed and
              delivered to Franchisor a nondisclosure and non-competition
              agreement in a form satisfactory to Franchisor and in substance
              the same as the nondisclosure and non-competition covenants
              contained in Sections 7 and 17; and
            </p>

            <p>
              the transferee agrees that it shall complete, to
              Franchisor&rsquo;s satisfaction, a training program in substance
              similar to the initial training described in Section 8.1 prior to
              assuming the management of the day-to-day operation of the
              Franchised Business.

            <p>
              all obligations of Franchisee to Franchisor or any Affiliate are

              within Franchisee&rsquo;s or its Designated Manager&rsquo;s
              principal residence, and shall not be held liable for trespass or

              pertinent documents including any contract or due diligence
              materials, to Franchisor, except with regards to a sale or
              transfer to a family member. The offer must apply only to an
              approved sale of the assets or interests listed above and may not

              for the price and on the same terms and conditions contained in
              such offer communicated to Franchisee. Franchisor has the right to
              substitute cash for the fair market value of any form of payment
              proposed in such offer. Franchisor&rsquo;s credit shall be deemed
              at least equal to the credit of any proposed buyer. After
              providing notice to Franchisee of Franchisor&rsquo;s intent to
              exercise this right of first refusal, Franchisor shall have up to
              sixty (60) days to close the purchase. Franchisor shall be
              entitled to receive from Franchisee all customary representations
              and warranties given by Franchisee as the seller of the assets or
              such ownership interest or, at Franchisor&rsquo;s election, such
              representations and warranties contained in the proposal.

              owners, subject to Franchisor&rsquo;s prior written approval as
              required by Section 18.2. Should the sale fail to close within 120
              days after the offer is delivered to Franchisor,
              Franchisor&rsquo;s right of first refusal shall renew and be
              implemented in accordance with this Section.
            </p>

            <p>19.4 Sales or Transfers to Family Excepted</p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              If Franchisee proposes to sell or otherwise transfer the
              Franchised Business (or any of its assets outside of the normal
              course of business), any ownership interest in Franchisee or any
              ownership interest in the Franchise granted hereunder to a member
              of Franchisee&rsquo;s (or its owners&rsquo;) family, then the

              Franchisee from full compliance with the terms and conditions of
              Section 18.2 prior to a sale or transfer to family according to
              this Section.

              representation on behalf of Franchisor, or to create any
              obligation, express or implied, on Franchisor&rsquo;s behalf.
              During the term of this Agreement, and any extension or renewal
              hereof, Franchisee shall hold itself out to the public only as a
              franchisee and an owner of the Franchised Business operating the
              Franchised Business according to a franchise from Franchisor.
              Franchisee shall take such affirmative action as may be necessary
              to do so including, without limitation, exhibiting a notice of
              that fact in a conspicuous place on all forms, stationery or other
              written materials, the content of which Franchisor has the right
              to specify. Under no circumstances shall Franchisor be liable for
              any act, omission, contract, debt, nor any other obligation of
              Franchisee. Franchisor shall in no way be responsible for any
              injuries to persons or property resulting from the operation of
              the Franchised Business by Franchisee. Any third-party contractors
              and vendors retained by Franchisee to convert or construct the
              premises are independent contractors of Franchisee alone.

            <p>21.3 Indemnification</p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              Franchisee shall hold harmless and indemnify Franchisor, any
              Affiliate, all holders of a legal or beneficial interest in
              Franchisor and all officers, directors, executives, managers,
              members, partners, owners, employees, agents, successors and
              assigns (collectively &ldquo;Franchisor Indemnities&rdquo;) from
              and against all losses, damages, fines, costs, expenses or
              liability (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and all
              other costs of litigation) incurred in connection with any action,
              suit, demand, claim, investigation or proceeding, or any
              settlement thereof, which arises from or is based upon
              Franchisee&rsquo;s (a) ownership or operation of the Franchised
              Business; (b) violation, breach or asserted violation or breach of
              any federal, state or local law, regulation or rule; (c) breach of
              any representation, warranty, covenant, or provision of this
              Agreement or any other agreement between Franchisee and Franchisor
              (or an Affiliate); (d) defamation of Franchisor or the System; (e)
              acts, errors or omissions committed or incurred in connection with
              the Franchised Business; or (f) infringement, violation or alleged
              infringement or violation of any Mark, patent or copyright or any
              misuse of the Trade Secrets or other Confidential Information. The
              obligations of this Section 21.3 shall expressly survive the
              termination of this Agreement.
            </p>

            <p>21.4 Right to Retain Counsel</p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              Franchisee shall give Franchisor immediate notice of any such
              action, suit, demand, claim, investigation, or proceeding that may
              give rise to a claim for indemnification by a Franchisor
              Indemnity. Franchisor has the right to retain counsel of its own
              choosing in connection with any such action, suit, demand, claim,
              investigation or proceeding. In order to protect persons,
              property, Franchisor&rsquo;s reputation or the goodwill of others,
              Franchisor has the right to, at any time without notice, take such
              remedial or corrective actions as it deems expedient with respect
              to any action, suit, demand, claim, investigation or proceeding
              if, in Franchisor&rsquo;s sole judgment, there are grounds to
              believe any of the acts or circumstances listed above have
              occurred. If Franchisor&rsquo;s exercise of its rights under this
              Section causes any of Franchisee&rsquo;s insurers to refuse to pay
              a third-party claim, all cause of action and legal remedies
              Franchisee might have against such insurer shall automatically be
              assigned to Franchisor without the need for any further action on
              either party&rsquo;s part. Under no circumstances shall Franchisor
              be required or obligated to seek coverage from third parties or
              otherwise mitigate losses in order to maintain a claim against
              Franchisee. The failure to pursue such remedy or mitigate such
              loss shall in no way reduce the amounts recoverable by Franchisor
              from Franchisee. Franchisee agrees to not be a party to class
              action suit against the Franchisor or any of its Affiliates under
              any circumstances.
            </p>

            <p>22. GENERAL CONDITIONS AND PROVISIONS</p>

            <p>22.1 No Waiver</p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              No failure of Franchisor to exercise any power reserved to it
              hereunder, or to insist upon strict compliance by Franchisee with
              any obligation or condition hereunder, and no custom nor practice
              of the parties in variance with the terms hereof, shall constitute
              a waiver of Franchisor&rsquo;s right to demand exact compliance
              with the terms of this Agreement. Waiver by Franchisor of any
              particular default by Franchisee shall not be binding unless in
              writing and executed by Franchisor and shall not affect nor impair
              Franchisor&rsquo;s right with respect to any subsequent default of
              the same or of a different nature. Subsequent acceptance by
              Franchisor of any payment(s) due shall not be deemed to be a
              waiver by Franchisor of any preceding breach by Franchisee of any
              terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement.
            </p>

            <p>22.2 Injunctive Relief</p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              As any breach by Franchisee of any of the restrictions contained
              in Sections 6, 7, and 17 would result in irreparable injury to
              Franchisor, and as the damages arising out of any such breach
              would be difficult to ascertain, in addition to all other remedies
              provided by law or in equity, Franchisor shall be entitled to seek
              injunctive relief (whether a restraining order, a preliminary
              injunction or a permanent injunction) against any such breach,
              whether actual or contemplated, without the necessity of posting
              security or bond and Franchisee shall be responsible for
              Franchisor&rsquo;s reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees incurred in
              pursuing the same. Franchisor&rsquo;s right to seek injunctive
              relief will not affect the parties&rsquo; waiver of jury trial and
              covenant to arbitrate all disputes in accordance with Section
              23.7. Franchisor&rsquo;s rights herein shall include pursuing
              injunctive relief through arbitration or in a state or federal
              court.

              of the recipient party); (b) on the next business day after

              of Obligations attached as Schedule 3, through which such holders
              agree to assume and discharge all of Franchisee&rsquo;s
              obligations under this Agreement and to be personally liable
              hereunder for all of the same.

            <p>22.6 Approvals</p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              Whenever this Agreement requires the prior approval or consent of
              Franchisor, Franchisee shall make a timely written request to
              Franchisor for such approval and, except as otherwise provided
              herein, any approval or consent granted shall be effective only if
              in writing. Franchisor makes no warranties or guarantees upon
              which Franchisee may rely, and assumes no liability or obligation
              to Franchisee or any third party to which it would not otherwise
              be subject, by providing any waiver, approval, advice, consent or
              services to Franchisee in connection with this Agreement, or by
              reason of any neglect, delay or denial of any request for
              approval.

            <p>22.7 Entire Agreement</p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              This Agreement and all exhibits to this Agreement constitute the
              entire agreement between the parties and supersede any and all
              prior negotiations, understandings, representations, and
              agreements. Nothing in this or in any related agreement, however,
              is intended to disclaim the representations we made in the
              franchise disclosure document that we furnished to you. No
              amendment, change or variance from this Agreement shall be binding

            <p>22.8 Severability and Modification</p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              Except as noted below, each paragraph, part, term and provision of
              this Agreement shall be considered severable. If any paragraph,
              part, term or provision herein is ruled to be unenforceable,
              unreasonable or invalid, such ruling shall not impair the
              operation of or affect the remaining portions, paragraphs, parts,
              terms and provisions of this Agreement, and the latter shall
              continue to be given full force and effect and bind the parties;
              and such unenforceable, unreasonable or invalid paragraphs, parts,
              terms or provisions shall be deemed not part of this Agreement.

              {" "}
              Notwithstanding the above, each of the covenants contained in
              Sections 7 and 17 shall be construed as independent of any other
              covenant or provision of this Agreement. If all or any portion of
              any such covenant is held to be unenforceable, unreasonable, or
              invalid, then it shall be amended to provide for limitations on
              disclosure of Trade Secrets or other Confidential Information or
              on competition to the maximum extent provided or permitted by law.

              All captions herein are intended solely for the convenience of the

            <p>22.10 Force Majeure</p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              Whenever a period of time is provided in this Agreement for either
              party to perform any act, except pay monies, neither party shall
              be liable nor responsible for any delays due to strikes, lockouts,
              casualties, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental regulation
              or control or other causes beyond the reasonable control of the
              parties, and the time period for the performance of such act shall
              be extended for the amount of time of the delay. This clause shall
              not result in an extension of the term of this Agreement.
            </p>

            <p>22.11 Timing</p>

            <p>

              Time is of the essence. Except as in Section 22.10, failure to
              perform any act within the time required or permitted by this
              Agreement shall be a material breach.
            </p>

            <p>22.12 Withholding Payments</p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              Franchisee shall not, for any reason, withhold payment of any
              Royalty Fees or other amounts due to Franchisor or to an
              Affiliate. Franchisee shall not withhold or offset any amounts,
              damages or other monies allegedly due to Franchisee against any
              amounts due to Franchisor. No endorsement or statement on any
              payment for less than the full amount due to Franchisor will be
              construed as an acknowledgment of payment in full, or an accord
              and satisfaction, and Franchisor has the right to accept and cash
              any such payment without prejudice to Franchisor&rsquo;s right to
              recover the full amount due, or pursue any other remedy provided
              in this Agreement or by law. Franchisor has the right to apply any
              payments made by Franchisee against any of Franchisee&rsquo;s past
              due indebtedness as Franchisor deems appropriate. Franchisor shall
              set off sums Franchisor owes to Franchisee against any unpaid
              debts owed by Franchisee to Franchisor.
            </p>

            <p>22.13 Further Assurances</p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              Each party to this Agreement will execute and deliver such further
              instruments, contracts, forms or other documents, and will perform
              such further acts, as may be necessary or desirable to perform or
              complete any term, covenant or obligation contained in this
              Agreement.
            </p>

            <p>22.14 Third Party Beneficiaries</p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, nothing in this
              Agreement is intended, nor shall be deemed, to confer upon any
              person or legal entity other than Franchisor or Franchisee, and
              their respective successors and assigns as may be contemplated by
              this Agreement, any rights or remedies under this Agreement.

            <p>22.15 Multiple Originals</p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              Both parties will execute multiple copies of this Agreement, and
              each executed copy will be deemed an original.

            <p>23. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</p>

            <p>23.1 Choice of Law</p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              Except as to claims governed by federal law, Delaware law governs
              all claims that in any way relate to or arise out of this
              Agreement or any of the dealings of the parties
              (&ldquo;Claims&rdquo;). However, no laws regulating the sale of
              franchises or governing the relationship between franchisor and
              franchisee shall apply unless the jurisdictional requirements of
              such laws are met independently of this paragraph.
            </p>

            <p>23.2 Jurisdiction and Venue</p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              You and we agree that venue and jurisdiction for any Claims,
              except those required to be submitted to arbitration, shall be
              proper solely in the state and federal court nearest to our
              corporate headquarters, presently located in Dover, Delaware.
              However, if you are an Illinois, Maryland, or Washington State
              resident or your franchise territory is located in Illinois,
              Maryland, or Washington State, you agree to bring any Claims, if
              at all, solely in arbitration before the American Arbitration
              Association in the city or county where our corporate headquarters
              are located.

            <p>23.3 Jury Waiver</p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              In any trial between any of the parties as to any Claims, you and
              we agree to waive our rights to a jury trial and instead have such
              action tried by a judge.
            </p>

            <p>23.4 Class Action Waiver</p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              You agree to bring any Claims, if at all, individually and you
              shall not join such claim with claims of any other person or
              entity or bring, join or participate in a class action against us.
            </p>

            <p>23.5 Limitation of Damages</p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              Franchisee and Franchisor each waive, to the fullest extent
              permitted by law, any right or claim for any punitive or exemplary
              damages against the other and agree that if there is a dispute
              with the other, each will be limited to the recovery of actual
              damages sustained by it including reasonable accounting and legal
              fees as provided in Section 22.4. Franchisee waives and disclaims
              any right to consequential damages in any action or claim against
              Franchisor concerning this Agreement or any related agreement. In
              any claim or action brought by Franchisee against Franchisor

            <p> 4. Reasonableness of Restrictions</p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              Individual acknowledges that each of the terms stated here,
              including the restrictive covenants, is fair and reasonable and is
              reasonably required for the protection of Franchisee, Company, and
              Company&rsquo;s Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information,
              the Company&rsquo;s business system, network of franchises and
              trade and service marks, and Individual waives any right to
              challenge these restrictions as being overly broad, unreasonable
              or otherwise unenforceable. If, however, a court of competent
              jurisdiction determines that any such restriction is unreasonable
              or unenforceable, then Individual shall submit to the reduction of
              any such activity, time period or geographic restriction necessary
              to enable the court to enforce such restrictions to the fullest
              extent permitted under applicable law. It is the desire and intent
              of the parties that the provisions of this Agreement shall be
              enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and
              public policies applied in any jurisdiction where enforcement is
              sought.

              Non-Competition
            </p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              Individual further acknowledges that an actual or threatened
              violation of the covenants contained in this Agreement will cause
              Franchisee and Company immediate and irreparable harm, damage and
              injury that cannot be fully compensated for by an award of damages
              or other remedies at law. Accordingly, Franchisee and/or Company
              shall be entitled, as a matter of right, to an injunction from any
              court of competent jurisdiction restraining any further violation
              by Individual of this Agreement without any requirement to show
              any actual damage or to post any bond or other security. Such
              right to an injunction shall be cumulative and in addition to, and
              not in limitation of, any other rights and remedies that
              Franchisee and Company may have at law or in equity.

            <p>
              {" "}
              a) Choice of Law. Except as to claims governed by federal law, the
              local law where the Franchised Business is located governs all
              claims that in any way relate to or arise out of this Agreement or
              any of the dealings of the parties (&ldquo;Claims&rdquo;).
              However, no laws regulating the sale of franchises or governing
              the relationship between franchisor and franchisee shall apply
              unless the jurisdictional requirements of such laws are met
              independently of this paragraph.
            </p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              b) Jurisdiction and Venue. You and we agree that venue and
              jurisdiction for any Claims, except those required to be submitted
              to arbitration, shall be proper solely in the state and federal
              court nearest to our corporate headquarters.
            </p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              c) Jury Waiver. In any trial between any of the parties as to any
              Claims, you and we agree to waive our rights to a jury trial and
              instead have such action tried by a judge.
            </p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              d) Class Action Waiver. You agree to bring any Claims, if at all,
              individually and you shall not join such claim with claims of any
              other person or entity or bring, join or participate in a class
              action against us. e) Punitive Damages Waiver. As to any Claims,
              you and we agree to waive our rights, if any, to seek or recover
              punitive damages.
            </p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              f) Limitation of Actions. You agree to bring any Claims against
              us, if at all, within one (1) year of the occurrence of the facts
              giving rise to such Claims, and that any action not brought within
              this period shall be barred as a claim, counterclaim, defense, or
              set-off.

            <p>
              (g) Prior Notice of Claims. As a condition precedent to commencing
              an action for a Claim, you must notify us within thirty (30) days
              after the occurrence of the violation or breach, and failure to
              timely give such notice shall preclude any claim for damages.
            </p>

            <p>
              (h) Internal Dispute Resolution. You must first bring any Claim to
              our CEO, after providing notice as in Section 6(g) above. You must
              exhaust this internal dispute resolution procedure before you may
              bring your Claim before a third party.
            </p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              (i) Mediation and Arbitration. Before you may bring any Claim
              against us court, you agree to try for a period of 60 days to
              mediate such claim before a mutually agreed to mediator in the
              city or county where our headquarters are located. If we cannot
              mutually agree on a mediator, you and we agree to use the
              mediation services of the American Arbitration Association
              (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), and split any AAA and mediator fees equally.
            </p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              If mediation is unsuccessful and you decide to pursue a legal
              claim against us, you agree to bring such claim solely in binding
              arbitration conducted in the city or county of our headquarters in
              accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
              Arbitration Association then in effect. The proceedings will be
              held by a single arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrator will
              be final and binding upon the parties. Judgment upon the award
              rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having
              personal and subject matter jurisdiction.
            </p>

            <p>
              (j) Waiver of Bond. You agree that if we are forced to bring suit
              to enforce any provision of this Agreement, you agree to waive any
              requirement that we post bond to obtain a temporary, preliminary,
              or permanent injunction to enforce these duties.
            </p>

            <p>
              (k) Attorney Fees. If we are the substantially prevailing party as
              to any Claims, you agree to reimburse our costs and attorney fees
              incurred in pursuing or defending the Claims.
            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>
              1. Use. Tenant is a franchisee of Franchisor. The Leased Premises
              shall be used only for the operation of an Our Maids business (or
              any name authorized by Franchisor).
            </p>

            <p>
              2. Notice of Default and Opportunity To Cure. Landlord shall
              provide Franchisor with copies of any written notice of default
              (&ldquo;Default&rdquo;) given to Tenant under the Lease, and
              Landlord grants to Franchisor the option (but not the obligation)
              to cure any Default under the Lease (should Tenant fail to do so)
              within 10 days after the expiration of the period in which Tenant
              may cure the Default.
            </p>

            <p>
              3. Termination of Lease. Landlord shall copy Franchisor on any
              notice of termination of the Lease. If Landlord terminates the
              Lease for Tenant&rsquo;s Default, Franchisor shall have the option
              to enter into a new Lease with Landlord on the same terms and
              conditions as the terminated Lease, subject to Landlord&rsquo;s
              approval in its reasonable discretion. To exercise this option,
              Franchisor must notify Landlord within 10 days after Franchisor
              receives notice of the termination of the Lease.
            </p>

            <p>
              4. Termination of Franchise Agreement. If the Franchise Agreement
              between Franchisor and Tenant is terminated during the term of the
              Lease, then upon the written request of Franchisor, Landlord and
              Tenant consent to allow Franchisor to assume any existing term of
              the Lease (the &ldquo;Assumption&rdquo;), provided that any and
              all defaults have been cured and all payments due under the Lease
              are current, and to enter into a written agreement providing for
              such Assumption. In the event of an Assumption, Landlord will
              deliver possession of the Leased Premises to Franchisor free and
              clear of any rights of the Tenant or any third party. Landlord
              further consents to give Franchisor the right, following the
              Assumption, to assign its interest in the Lease or to sublet the
              Leased Premises to another franchisee of Franchisor with
              reasonable consent from the Landlord.
            </p>

            <p>
              5. Assignment and Subletting. Notwithstanding any provision of the
              Lease to the contrary, Tenant shall have the right to assign or
              sublet the Lease to Franchisor, provided that no such assignment
              or sublease shall relieve Tenant or any guarantor of liability
              under the Lease. If Franchisor becomes the lessee of the Leased
              Premises, then Franchisor shall have the right to assign or
              sublease its lease to a franchisee of Franchisor&rsquo;s brand,
              subject to Landlord&rsquo;s approval in its reasonable discretion.
            </p>

            <p>
              6. Authorization. Tenant authorizes Landlord and Franchisor to
              communicate directly with each other about Tenant and
              Tenant&rsquo;s business.
            </p>

            <p>
              7. Right to Enter. Upon the expiration or termination of the
              Franchise Agreement or the Lease, or the termination of
              Tenant&rsquo;s right of possession of the Leased Premises,
              Franchisor or its designee may, after giving reasonable prior
              notice to Landlord, enter the Leased Premises within 10 days of
              such expiration or termination, to take any such actions as may be
              consistent with its rights under this Lease Addendum or to remove
              signs and other material bearing Franchisor&rsquo;s brand name,
              trademarks, and commercial symbols.
            </p>

            <p>
              8. No Liability. By executing this Addendum, Franchisor does not
              assume any liability with respect to the Leased Premises or any
              obligation as Tenant under the Lease.

            <p>
              16.2.1 Termination by Us Without Right to Cure. We may terminate
              this Agreement without notice and the opportunity to cure for any
              of the following reasons:
            </p>

            <p>
              (a) The franchisee or the business to which the franchise relates
              has been judicially determined to be insolvent, all or a
              substantial part of the assets thereof are assigned to or for the
              benefit of any creditor, or the franchisee admits his or her
              inability to pay his or her debts as they come due; (b) The
              franchisee abandons the franchise by failing to operate the
              business for five consecutive days during which the franchisee is
              required to operate the business under the terms of the franchise,
              or any shorter period after which it is not unreasonable under the
              facts and circumstances for the franchisor to conclude that the
              franchisee does not intend to continue to operate the franchise,
              unless such failure to operate is due to fire, flood, earthquake,
              or other similar causes beyond the franchisee&rsquo;s control; (c)
              The franchisor and franchisee agree in writing to terminate the
              franchise; (d) The franchisee makes any material
              misrepresentations relating to the acquisition of the franchise
              business or the franchisee engages in conduct which reflects
              materially and unfavorably upon the operation and reputation of
              the franchise business or system; (e) The franchisee fails, for a
              period of 10 days after notification of noncompliance, to comply
              with any federal, state, or local law or regulation, including,
              but not limited to, all health, safety, building, and labor laws
              or regulations applicable to the operation of the franchise; (f)
              The franchisee, after curing any failure in accordance with
              Section 16.2.2 engages in the same noncompliance whether or not
              such noncompliance is corrected after notice; (g) The franchisee
              breaches the franchise agreement three or more times in a 12-month
              period, whether or not corrected after notice; (h) The franchised
              business or business premises of the franchise are seized, taken
              over, or foreclosed by a government official in the exercise of
              his or her duties, or seized, taken over, or foreclosed by a
              creditor, lienholder, or lessor, provided that a final judgment
              against the franchisee remains unsatisfied for 30 days (unless a
              supersedeas or other appeal bond has been filed); or a levy of
              execution has been made upon the license granted by the franchise
              agreement or upon any property used in the franchised business,
              and it is not discharged within five days of such levy; (i) The
              franchisee is convicted of a felony or any other criminal
              misconduct which is relevant to the operation of the franchise;
              (j) The franchisee fails to pay any franchise fees or other
              amounts due to the franchisor or its affiliate within five days
              after receiving written notice that such fees are overdue; or (k)
              The franchisor makes a reasonable determination that continued
              operation of the franchise by the franchisee will result in an
              imminent danger to public health or safety. 16.2.2 Termination by
              Us with Opportunity to Cure. We may terminate this Agreement,
              after sending you notice and a 60 day opportunity to cure, for any
              other breach of this Agreement.

              If any of the terms of the Franchise Agreement are inconsistent
              with the terms below, the terms below control.

            <p>
              {" "}
              1. Any claims arising under the Maryland Franchise Registration
              and Disclosure Law must be brought within 3 years after the grant
              of the franchise.
            </p>

              2. A general release required as a condition of renewal, sale,
              and/or assignment/transfer shall not apply to any liability under
              the Maryland Franchise Registration and Disclosure Law.

            <p>
              {" "}
              3. This franchise agreement provides that disputes are resolved
              through arbitration. A Maryland franchise regulation states that
              it is an unfair or deceptive practice to require a franchisee to
              waive its right to file a lawsuit in Maryland claiming a violation
              of the Maryland Franchise Law. In light of the Federal Arbitration
              Act, there is some dispute as to whether this forum selection
              requirement is legally enforceable.
            </p>

            <p>
              4. All representations requiring prospective franchisees to assent
              to a release, estoppel or waiver of liability are not intended to
              nor shall they act as a release, estoppel or waiver of any
              liability incurred under the Maryland Franchise Registration and
              Disclosure Law.

            <p>MINNESOTA ADDENDUM TO THE FRANCHISE AGREEMENT</p>

            <p>
              If any of the terms of the Franchise Agreement are inconsistent
              with the terms below, the terms below control.
            </p>

            <p>
              Minn. Stat. &sect;80C.21 and Minn. Rule 2860.4400(J) prohibit the
              franchisor from requiring litigation to be conducted outside
              Minnesota, requiring waiver of a jury trial, or requiring the
              franchisee to consent to liquidated damages, termination penalties
              or judgment notes. In addition, nothing in the Franchise
              Disclosure Document or agreements can abrogate or reduce (1) any
              of the franchisee&rsquo;s rights as provided for in Minnesota
              Statutes, Chapter 80C, or (2) franchisee&rsquo;s rights to any
              procedure, forum, or remedies provided for by the laws of the
              jurisdiction.
            </p>

            <p>
              With respect to franchises governed by Minnesota law, the
              franchisor will comply with Minn. Stat. Sec. 80C.14 Subds. 3, 4,
              and 5 which require (except in certain specified cases), that a
              franchisee be given 90 days&rsquo; notice of termination (with 60
              days to cure) and 180 days&rsquo; notice for non-renewal of the
              franchise agreement and that consent to the transfer of the
              franchise will not be unreasonably withheld.
            </p>

            <p>
              The franchisor will protect the franchisee&rsquo;s rights to use
              the trademarks, service marks, trade names, logotypes or other
              commercial symbols or indemnify the franchisee from any loss,
              costs or expenses arising out of any claim, suit or demand
              regarding the use of the name.
            </p>

            <p>
              Minnesota considers it unfair to not protect the
              franchisee&rsquo;s right to use the trademarks. Refer to Minnesota
              Statutes 80C.12, Subd. 1(g).
            </p>

            <p>
              Minnesota Rules 2860.4400(D) prohibits a franchisor from requiring
              a franchisee to assent to a general release.
            </p>

            <p>
              The franchisee cannot consent to the franchisor obtaining
              injunctive relief. The franchisor may seek injunctive relief. See
              Minn. Rules 2860.4400J.
            </p>

            <p>Also, a court will determine if a bond is required.</p>

            <p>
              Any Limitations of Claims section must comply with Minnesota
              Statutes, Section 80C.17, Subd. 5.
            </p>

            <p>
              Section 3.8 of the Franchise Agreement is modified to reduce the
              fee for insufficient funds to $30.

              venue, jury waiver, and waiver of punitive damages are hereby
              deleted and in their place is substituted the following language:
            </p>

            <p>
              &ldquo;You agree to bring any claim against us, including our
              present and former employees, agents, and affiliates, which in any

              dealings of the parties hereto, solely in arbitration before the
              American Arbitration Association.&rdquo;
            </p>

            <p>
              4. North Dakota law governs any cause of action arising out of the
              franchise agreement.
            </p>

            <p>
              5. Any requirement in the Franchise Agreement that requires you to
              pay all costs and expenses incurred by us in enforcing the
              agreement is void. Instead, the prevailing party in any
              enforcement action is entitled to recover all costs and expenses
              including attorney's fees.

              with the terms below, the terms below control.
            </p>

            <p>
              1. If the franchise agreement contains any provisions that
              conflict with the Rhode Island Franchise Investment Act, the
              provisions of this Addendum shall prevail to the extent of such
              conflict.
            </p>

            <p>
              2. Any provision in the franchise agreement restricting
              jurisdiction or venue to a forum outside of Rhode Island is void
              with respect to a claim otherwise enforceable under the Rhode
              Island Franchise Investment Act. 3. Any provision in the franchise
              agreement requiring the application of the laws of a state other
              than Rhode Island is void with respect to a claim otherwise
              enforceable under the Rhode Island Franchise Investment Act. 4.
              The Rhode Island Franchise Investment Act stipulates that you
              cannot release or waive any rights granted under this Act. Any
              provision of this franchise agreement, which constitutes a waiver
              of rights granted under the Act, is superseded.
            </p>

            <p>
              If any of the terms of the Franchise Agreement are inconsistent
              with the terms below, the terms below control.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the event of a conflict of laws, the provisions of the
              Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, Chapter 19.100 RCW
              will prevail.
            </p>

            <p>
              RCW 19.100.180 may supersede the franchise agreement in your
              relationship with the franchisor including the areas of
              termination and renewal of your franchise. There may also be court
              decisions which may supersede the franchise agreement in your
              relationship with the franchisor including the areas of
              termination and renewal of your franchise.
            </p>

            <p>
              In any arbitration or mediation involving a franchise purchased in
              Washington, the arbitration or mediation site will be either in
              the state of Washington, or in a place mutually agreed upon at the
              time of the arbitration or mediation, or as determined by the
              arbitrator or mediator at the time of arbitration or mediation. In
              addition, if litigation is not precluded by the franchise
              agreement, a franchisee may bring an action or proceeding arising
              out of or in connection with the sale of franchises, or a
              violation of the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act,
              in Washington.
            </p>

            <p>
              A release or waiver of rights executed by a franchisee may not
              include rights under the Washington Franchise Investment
              Protection Act or any rule or order thereunder except when
              executed pursuant to a negotiated settlement after the agreement
              is in effect and where the parties are represented by independent
              counsel. Provisions such as those which unreasonably restrict or
              limit the statute of limitations period for claims under the Act,
              or rights or remedies under the Act such as a right to a jury
              trial, may not be enforceable.
            </p>

            <p>
              Transfer fees are collectable to the extent that they reflect the
              franchisor&rsquo;s reasonable estimated or actual costs in
              effecting a transfer.
            </p>

            <p>
              Pursuant to RCW 49.62.020, a noncompetition covenant is void and
              unenforceable against an employee, including an employee of a
              franchisee, unless the employee&rsquo;s earnings from the party
              seeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed $100,000 per year (an
              amount that will be adjusted annually for inflation). In addition,
              a noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable against an
              independent contractor of a franchisee under RCW 49.62.030 unless
              the independent contractor&rsquo;s earnings from the party seeking
              enforcement, when annualized, exceed $250,000 per year (an amount
              that will be adjusted annually for inflation). As a result, any
              provisions contained in the franchise agreement or elsewhere that
              conflict with these limitations are void and unenforceable in
              Washington.
            </p>

            <p>
              RCW 49.62.060 prohibits a franchisor from restricting,
              restraining, or prohibiting a franchisee from (i) soliciting or
              hiring any employee of a franchisee of the same franchisor or (ii)
              soliciting or hiring any employee of the franchisor. As a result,
              any such provisions contained in the franchise agreement or
              elsewhere are void and unenforceable in Washington.
            </p>

            <p>
              Section 17.2.2(a) is modified to also provide that the post-term
              non-compete will only apply to a 25 mile radius of your Franchised
              Business.
            </p>

            <p>
              Section 21.3 is modified to also provide that the indemnification
              does not extend to liabilities resulting from the gross negligence
              of willful misconduct of any Franchisor indemnitee.
            </p>

              If the Franchise Agreement contains any provision that conflict
              with the Wisconsin Fair Dealership Law, the provisions of this
              Addendum shall prevail to the extent of such conflict.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Franchise Agreement is amended to also include the following
              language:
            </p>

            <p>
              With respect to franchises governed by Wisconsin law, the
              Wisconsin Fair Dealership Law applies to most, if not all,
              franchise agreements and prohibits the termination, cancellation,
              non-renewal or the substantial change of the competitive
              circumstances of a dealership agreement without good cause. That
              Law further provides that 90 days&rsquo; prior written notice of a
              proposed termination, etc. must be given to the dealer. The dealer
              has 60 days to cure the deficiency and if the deficiency is cured,
              the notice is void.

              such default is not cured within thirty (30) days after notice of
              the default, we may terminate your rights to develop any
              territories as to which you have breached the above Development
              Schedule. Also, this Agreement terminates if and when no Franchise
              Agreement is in place between the parties.

              You agree that for our consideration in allowing the Development

            <p>MARYLAND ADDENDUM TO THE AREA DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT</p>

            <p>
              If any of the terms of the Area Development Agreement are
              inconsistent with the terms below, the terms below control.
            </p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              1. Any claims arising under the Maryland Franchise Registration
              and Disclosure Law must be brought within 3 years after the grant
              of the franchise.
            </p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              2. A general release required as a condition of renewal, sale,
              and/or assignment/transfer shall not apply to any liability under
              the Maryland Franchise Registration and Disclosure Law.

              {" "}
              3. This franchise agreement provides that disputes are resolved
              through arbitration. A Maryland franchise regulation states that
              it is an unfair or deceptive practice to require a franchisee to
              waive its right to file a lawsuit in Maryland claiming a violation
              of the Maryland Franchise Law. In light of the Federal Arbitration
              Act, there is some dispute as to whether this forum selection
              requirement is legally enforceable.

              4. All representations requiring prospective franchisees to assent
              to a release, estoppel or waiver of liability are not intended to
              nor shall they act as a release, estoppel or waiver of any
              liability incurred under the Maryland Franchise Registration and
              Disclosure Law.

            <p> MINNESOTA ADDENDUM TO THE AREA DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT</p>

            <p>
              If any of the terms of the Area Development Agreement are
              inconsistent with the terms below, the terms below control.
            </p>

            <p>
              Minn. Stat. &sect;80C.21 and Minn. Rule 2860.4400(J) prohibit the
              franchisor from requiring litigation to be conducted outside
              Minnesota, requiring waiver of a jury trial, or requiring the
              franchisee to consent to liquidated damages, termination penalties
              or judgment notes. In addition, nothing in the Franchise
              Disclosure Document or agreements can abrogate or reduce (1) any
              of the franchisee&rsquo;s rights as provided for in Minnesota
              Statutes, Chapter 80C, or (2) franchisee&rsquo;s rights to any
              procedure, forum, or remedies provided for by the laws of the
              jurisdiction.
            </p>

            <p>
              With respect to franchises governed by Minnesota law, the
              franchisor will comply with Minn. Stat. Sec. 80C.14 Subds. 3, 4,
              and 5 which require (except in certain specified cases), that a
              franchisee be given 90 days&rsquo; notice of termination (with 60
              days to cure) and 180 days&rsquo; notice for non-renewal of the
              franchise agreement and that consent to the transfer of the
              franchise will not be unreasonably withheld.
            </p>

            <p>
              The franchisor will protect the franchisee&rsquo;s rights to use
              the trademarks, service marks, trade names, logotypes or other
              commercial symbols or indemnify the franchisee from any loss,
              costs or expenses arising out of any claim, suit or demand
              regarding the use of the name.
            </p>

            <p>
              Minnesota considers it unfair to not protect the
              franchisee&rsquo;s right to use the trademarks. Refer to Minnesota
              Statutes 80C.12, Subd. 1(g).
            </p>

            <p>
              Minnesota Rules 2860.4400(D) prohibits a franchisor from requiring
              a franchisee to assent to a general release.
            </p>

            <p>
              The franchisee cannot consent to the franchisor obtaining
              injunctive relief. The franchisor may seek injunctive relief. See
              Minn. Rules 2860.4400J.
            </p>

            <p>Also, a court will determine if a bond is required.</p>

            <p>
              Any Limitations of Claims section must comply with Minnesota
              Statutes, Section 80C.17, Subd. 5.

            <p>WASHINGTON ADDENDUM TO THE AREA DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT</p>

            <p>
              As to franchises governed by the Washington Franchise Investment
              Protection Act, if any of the terms of the Disclosure Document are
              inconsistent with the terms below, the terms below control.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the event of a conflict of laws, the provisions of the
              Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, Chapter 19.100 RCW
              will prevail.
            </p>

            <p>
              RCW 19.100.180 may supersede the franchise agreement in your
              relationship with the franchisor including the areas of
              termination and renewal of your franchise. There may also be court
              decisions which may supersede the franchise agreement in your
              relationship with the franchisor including the areas of
              termination and renewal of your franchise.
            </p>

            <p>
              In any arbitration or mediation involving a franchise purchased in
              Washington, the arbitration or mediation site will be either in
              the state of Washington, or in a place mutually agreed upon at the
              time of the arbitration or mediation, or as determined by the
              arbitrator or mediator at the time of arbitration or mediation. In
              addition, if litigation is not precluded by the franchise
              agreement, a franchisee may bring an action or proceeding arising
              out of or in connection with the sale of franchises, or a
              violation of the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act,
              in Washington.
            </p>

            <p>
              A release or waiver of rights executed by a franchisee may not
              include rights under the Washington Franchise Investment
              Protection Act or any rule or order thereunder except when
              executed pursuant to a negotiated settlement after the agreement
              is in effect and where the parties are represented by independent
              counsel. Provisions such as those which unreasonably restrict or
              limit the statute of limitations period for claims under the Act,
              or rights or remedies under the Act such as a right to a jury
              trial, may not be enforceable.
            </p>

            <p>
              Transfer fees are collectable to the extent that they reflect the
              franchisor&rsquo;s reasonable estimated or actual costs in
              effecting a transfer.
            </p>

            <p>
              Pursuant to RCW 49.62.020, a noncompetition covenant is void and
              unenforceable against an employee, including an employee of a
              franchisee, unless the employee&rsquo;s earnings from the party
              seeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed $100,000 per year (an
              amount that will be adjusted annually for inflation). In addition,
              a noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable against an
              independent contractor of a franchisee under RCW 49.62.030 unless
              the independent contractor&rsquo;s earnings from the party seeking
              enforcement, when annualized, exceed $250,000 per year (an amount
              that will be adjusted annually for inflation). As a result, any
              provisions contained in the franchise agreement or elsewhere that
              conflict with these limitations are void and unenforceable in
              Washington.
            </p>

            <p>
              RCW 49.62.060 prohibits a franchisor from restricting,
              restraining, or prohibiting a franchisee from (i) soliciting or
              hiring any employee of a franchisee of the same franchisor or (ii)
              soliciting or hiring any employee of the franchisor. As a result,
              any such provisions contained in the franchise agreement or
              elsewhere are void and unenforceable in Washington.
            </p>

            <p>
              A release or waiver of rights signed by the franchisee shall not
              include rights under the Washington Franchise Investment
              Protection Act except when executed according to a negotiated
              settlement after the agreement is in effect and where the parties
              are represented by independent counsel. Provisions such as those
              that unreasonably restrict or limit the statute of limitations
              period for claims under the Act, rights or remedies under the Act
              such as a right to a jury trial may not be enforceable.
            </p>

              a release, estoppel or waiver of any liability are not intended to

            <p>
              Neither we nor any person or franchise broker in Item 2 of this
              disclosure document is subject to any currently effective order of
              any national securities association or national securities
              exchange, as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15
              U.S.C.A. 78a et seq., suspending or expelling these persons from

            </p>

            <p>
              Item 17 of the Disclosure Document is amended by adding the
              following paragraphs:
            </p>

            <p>
              California Business and Professions Code Sections 20000 through
              20043 provide rights to the franchisee concerning termination,
              transfer, or non-renewal of a franchise. If the franchise
              agreement contains a provision that is inconsistent with the law,
              the law will control.
            </p>

            <p>
              Item 17.g. of the Disclosure Document is modified to state that,
              in addition to the grounds for immediate termination specified in
              Item 17.h., the franchisor can terminate upon written notice and a
              60 day opportunity to cure for a breach of the Franchise
              Agreement.
            </p>

            <p>
              Item 17.h. of the Disclosure Document is modified to state that
              the franchisor can terminate immediately for insolvency,
              abandonment, mutual agreement to terminate, material
              misrepresentation, legal violation persisting 10 days after
              notice, repeated breaches, judgment, criminal conviction, monies
              owed to the franchisor more than 5 days past due, and imminent
              danger to public health or safety.
            </p>

            <p>
              The franchise agreement requires binding arbitration. Arbitration
              will occur in Dover, DE. This provision may not be enforceable
              under California law.
            </p>

            <p>
              The franchise agreement contains a covenant not to compete which
              extends beyond the termination of the franchise. This provision
              may not be enforceable under California law.
            </p>

            <p>
              The franchise agreement requires application of the laws of

            <p>ILLINOIS ADDENDUM TO THE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT</p>

            <p>
              As to franchises governed by the Illinois Franchise Disclosure
              Act, if any of the terms of the Disclosure Document are
              inconsistent with the terms below, the terms below control.
            </p>

            <p>Item 17.w. is modified to provide that Illinois law applies.</p>

            <p>
              2. In conformance with Section 4 of the Illinois Franchise
              Disclosure Act, any provision in a franchise agreement that
              designates jurisdiction and venue in a forum outside of the State
              of Illinois is void. However, a franchise agreement may provide
              for arbitration to take place outside of Illinois.
            </p>

            <p>
              3. In conformance with Section 41 of the Illinois Franchise
              Disclosure Act, any condition, stipulation, or provision of the
              Franchise Agreement purporting to bind you to waive compliance
              with any provision of the Illinois Franchise Disclosure Act or any
              other law of the State of Illinois is void. 4. The conditions
              under which your Franchise Agreement can be terminated and your
              rights upon nonrenewal may be affected by Sections 19 and 20 of

            <p> MARYLAND ADDENDUM TO THE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT</p>

            <p>
              As to franchises governed by the Maryland Franchise Registration
              and Disclosure Law, if any of the terms of the Disclosure Document
              are inconsistent with the terms below, the terms below control. 1.
              Item 17.b. is modified to also provide, &ldquo;The general release
              required as a condition of renewal, sale, and/or
              assignment/transfer shall not apply to any liability under the
              Maryland Franchise Registration and Disclosure Law.&rdquo; 2. Item
              17.u. is modified to also provide, &ldquo;This franchise agreement
              provides that disputes are resolved through arbitration. A
              Maryland franchise regulation states that it is an unfair or
              deceptive practice to require a franchisee to waive its right to
              file a lawsuit in Maryland claiming a violation of the Maryland
              Franchise Law. In light of the Federal Arbitration Act, there is
              some dispute as to whether this forum selection requirement is
              legally enforceable.&rdquo; 3. Item 17.v. is modified to also
              provide, &ldquo;Any claims arising under the Maryland Franchise
              Registration and Disclosure Law must be brought within 3 years
              after the grant of the franchise.&rdquo;

            <p> MINNESOTA ADDENDUM TO THE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT</p>

            <p>
              As to franchises governed by the Minnesota franchise laws, if any
              of the terms of the Disclosure Document are inconsistent with the
              terms below, the terms below control.
            </p>

            <p>
              Minn. Stat. &sect;80C.21 and Minn. Rule 2860.4400(J) prohibit the
              franchisor from requiring litigation to be conducted outside
              Minnesota, requiring waiver of a jury trial, or requiring the
              franchisee to consent to liquidated damages, termination penalties
              or judgment notes. In addition, nothing in the Franchise
              Disclosure Document or agreements can abrogate or reduce (1) any
              of the franchisee&rsquo;s rights as provided for in Minnesota
              Statutes, Chapter 80C, or (2) franchisee&rsquo;s rights to any
              procedure, forum, or remedies provided for by the laws of the
              jurisdiction.
            </p>

            <p>
              With respect to franchises governed by Minnesota law, the
              franchisor will comply with Minn. Stat. Sec. 80C.14 Subds. 3, 4,
              and 5 which require (except in certain specified cases), that a
              franchisee be given 90 days&rsquo; notice of termination (with 60
              days to cure) and 180 days&rsquo; notice for non-renewal of the
              franchise agreement and that consent to the transfer of the
              franchise will not be unreasonably withheld.
            </p>

            <p>
              The franchisor will protect the franchisee&rsquo;s rights to use
              the trademarks, service marks, trade names, logotypes or other
              commercial symbols or indemnify the franchisee from any loss,
              costs or expenses arising out of any claim, suit or demand
              regarding the use of the name.
            </p>

            <p>
              Minnesota considers it unfair to not protect the
              franchisee&rsquo;s right to use the trademarks. Refer to Minnesota
              Statutes 80C.12, Subd. 1(g).
            </p>

            <p>
              Minnesota Rules 2860.4400(D) prohibits a franchisor from requiring
              a franchisee to assent to a general release.
            </p>

            <p>
              The franchisee cannot consent to the franchisor obtaining
              injunctive relief. The franchisor may seek injunctive relief. See
              Minn. Rules 2860.4400J.
            </p>

            <p>Also, a court will determine if a bond is required.</p>

            <p>
              The Limitations of Claims section must comply with Minnesota
              Statutes, Section 80C.17, Subd. 5.
            </p>

            <p>

              USE THE NEGOTIATING PROCESS TO PREVAIL UPON A PROSPECTIVE

              FORTH IN THIS FRANCHISE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT.
            </p>

              operations.
            </p>

              Act, if any of the terms of the Disclosure Document are

              prohibits a franchisee to be restricted in choice of jurisdiction
              or venue. To the extent any such restriction is purported to be
              required by us, it is void with respect to all franchisees
              governed under the laws of Rhode Island.

              As to franchises governed by the Washington Franchise Investment
              Protection Act, if any of the terms of the Disclosure Document are
              inconsistent with the terms below, the terms below control.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the event of a conflict of laws, the provisions of the
              Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, Chapter 19.100 RCW
              will prevail.
            </p>

            <p>
              RCW 19.100.180 may supersede the franchise agreement in your
              relationship with the franchisor including the areas of
              termination and renewal of your franchise. There may also be court
              decisions which may supersede the franchise agreement in your
              relationship with the franchisor including the areas of
              termination and renewal of your franchise.
            </p>

            <p>
              In any arbitration or mediation involving a franchise purchased in
              Washington, the arbitration or mediation site will be either in
              the state of Washington, or in a place mutually agreed upon at the
              time of the arbitration or mediation, or as determined by the
              arbitrator or mediator at the time of arbitration or mediation. In
              addition, if litigation is not precluded by the franchise
              agreement, a franchisee may bring an action or proceeding arising
              out of or in connection with the sale of franchises, or a
              violation of the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act,
              in Washington.
            </p>

            <p>
              A release or waiver of rights executed by a franchisee may not
              include rights under the Washington Franchise Investment
              Protection Act or any rule or order thereunder except when
              executed pursuant to a negotiated settlement after the agreement
              is in effect and where the parties are represented by independent
              counsel. Provisions such as those which unreasonably restrict or
              limit the statute of limitations period for claims under the Act,
              or rights or remedies under the Act such as a right to a jury
              trial, may not be enforceable.
            </p>

            <p>
              Transfer fees are collectable to the extent that they reflect the
              franchisor&rsquo;s reasonable estimated or actual costs in
              effecting a transfer.
            </p>

            <p>
              Pursuant to RCW 49.62.020, a noncompetition covenant is void and
              unenforceable against an employee, including an employee of a
              franchisee, unless the employee&rsquo;s earnings from the party
              seeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed $100,000 per year (an
              amount that will be adjusted annually for inflation). In addition,
              a noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable against an
              independent contractor of a franchisee under RCW 49.62.030 unless
              the independent contractor&rsquo;s earnings from the party seeking
              enforcement, when annualized, exceed $250,000 per year (an amount
              that will be adjusted annually for inflation). As a result, any
              provisions contained in the franchise agreement or elsewhere that
              conflict with these limitations are void and unenforceable in
              Washington.
            </p>

            <p>
              RCW 49.62.060 prohibits a franchisor from restricting,
              restraining, or prohibiting a franchisee from (i) soliciting or
              hiring any employee of a franchisee of the same franchisor or (ii)
              soliciting or hiring any employee of the franchisor. As a result,
              any such provisions contained in the franchise agreement or
              elsewhere are void and unenforceable in Washington.
            </p>

            <p>
              A release or waiver of rights signed by the franchisee shall not
              include rights under the Washington Franchise Investment
              Protection Act except when executed according to a negotiated
              settlement after the agreement is in effect and where the parties
              are represented by independent counsel. Provisions such as those
              that unreasonably restrict or limit the statute of limitations
              period for claims under the Act, rights or remedies under the Act
              such as a right to a jury trial may not be enforceable.
            </p>

            <p>
              Item 17.r. is modified to also provide that the post-term

              Business.

              As to franchises governed by the Wisconsin Fair Dealership Law, if
              any of the terms of the Disclosure Document are inconsistent with
              the terms below, the terms below control.
            </p>

            <p>Item 17 is modified to also provide:</p>

            <p>
              If the franchise agreement contains any provisions that conflict
              with the Wisconsin Fair Dealership Law, the provisions of this
              Addendum shall prevail to the extent of such conflict.
            </p>

            <p>
              With respect to franchises governed by Wisconsin law, the
              Wisconsin Fair Dealership Law applies to most, if not all,
              franchise agreements and prohibits the termination, cancellation,
              non-renewal or the substantial change of the competitive
              circumstances of a dealership agreement without good cause. That
              Law further provides that 90 days&rsquo; prior written notice of a
              proposed termination, etc. must be given to the dealer. The dealer
              has 60 days to cure the deficiency and if the deficiency is cured,
              the notice is void.

<p>This disclosure document summarizes certain provisions of your franchise agreement and other information in plain English. Read this disclosure document and all accompanying agreements carefully.

<p>The terms of your contract will govern your franchise relationship. Don&rsquo;t rely on the disclosure document alone to understand your contract. Read all of your contract carefully. Show your contract and this disclosure document to an advisor, like a lawyer or an accountant.</p>

<p>Buying a franchise is a complex investment. The information in this disclosure document can help you make up your mind. More information on franchising, such as &ldquo;A Consumer&rsquo;s Guide to Buying a Franchise,&rdquo; which can help you understand how to use this disclosure document, is available from the Federal Trade Commission. You can contact the FTC at 1-877-FTC-HELP or by writing to the FTC at 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580. You can also visit the FTC&rsquo;s home page at www.ftc.gov for additional information.</p>

<p>Call your state agency or visit your public library for other sources of information on franchising. There may be laws on franchising in your state. Ask your state agencies about them.</p>

<p>Issuance Date: March 20, 2023</p>

<p>How to Use This Franchise Disclosure Document</p>

<p>Here are some questions you may be asking about buying a franchise and tips on how to find more information:</p>

<p>What You Need To Know About Franchising Generally</p>

<p>Continuing responsibility to pay fees. You may have to pay royalties and other fees even if you are losing money.    Business model can change. The franchise agreement may allow the franchisor to change its manuals and business model without your consent. These changes may require you to make additional investments in your franchise business or may harm your franchise business.    Supplier restrictions. You may have to buy or lease items from the franchisor or a limited group of suppliers the franchisor designates. These items may be more expensive than similar items you could buy on your own.    Operating restrictions. The franchise agreement may prohibit you from operating a similar business during the term of the franchise. There are usually other restrictions. Some examples may include controlling your location, your access to customers, what you sell, how you market, and your hours of operation.    Competition from franchisor. Even if the franchise agreement grants you a territory, the franchisor may have the right to compete with you in your territory.    Renewal. Your franchise agreement may not permit you to renew. Even if it does, you may have to sign a new agreement with different terms and conditions in order to continue to operate your franchise business.    When your franchise ends. The franchise agreement may prohibit you from operating a similar business after your franchise ends even if you still have obligations to your landlord or other creditors.    Some States Require Registration   Your state may have a franchise law, or other law, that requires franchisors to register before offering or selling franchises in the state. Registration does not mean that the state recommends the franchise or has verified the information in this document. To find out if your state has a registration requirement, or to contact your state, use the agency information in Exhibit A.    Your state also may have laws that require special disclosures or amendments be made to your franchise agreement. If so, you should check the State Specific Addenda. See the Table of Contents for the location of the State Specific Addenda.  </p>

<p>Special Risks to Consider About This Franchise   Certain states require that the following risk(s) be highlighted:     1. Out-of-State Dispute Resolution. The franchise agreement requires you to resolve disputes with the franchisor by mediation, arbitration and/or litigation only in Delaware. Out-of-state mediation, arbitration, or litigation may force you to accept a less favorable settlement for disputes. It may also cost more to mediate, arbitrate, or litigate with the franchisor in Delaware than in your own state.</p>

<p> 2. Short Operating History. The franchisor is at an early stage of development and has a limited operating history. This franchise is likely to be a riskier investment than a franchise in a system with a longer operating history.</p>

<p> 3. Financial Condition. The Franchisor&rsquo;s financial condition as reflected in its financial statements (see Item 21) calls into question the Franchisor&rsquo;s financial ability to provide services and support to you.</p>

<p>Certain states may require other risks to be highlighted. Check the &ldquo;State Specific Addenda&rdquo; (if any) to see whether your state requires other risks to be highlighted.</p>

<p>MICHIGAN ADDENDUM TO THE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT</p>

<p>THE STATE OF MICHIGAN PROHIBITS CERTAIN UNFAIR PROVISIONS THAT ARE SOMETIMES IN FRANCHISE DOCUMENTS. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS ARE IN THESE FRANCHISE DOCUMENTS, THE PROVISIONS ARE VOID AND CANNOT BE ENFORCED AGAINST YOU:</p>

<p>(a) A prohibition on the right of a franchisee to join an association of franchisees.</p>

<p>(b) A requirement that a franchisee assent to a release, assignment, novation, waiver, or estoppel which deprives a franchisee of rights and protections provided in this act. This shall not preclude a franchisee, after entering into a franchise agreement, from settling any and all claims.</p>

<p>(c) A provision that permits a franchisor to terminate a franchise prior to the expiration of its term except for good cause. Good cause shall include the failure of the franchisee to comply with any lawful provision of the franchise agreement and to cure such failure after being given written notice thereof and a reasonable opportunity, which in no event need be more than 30 days, to cure such failure.</p>

<p>(d) A provision that permits a franchisor to refuse to renew a franchise without fairly compensating the franchisee by repurchase or other means for the fair market value at the time of expiration of the franchisee&rsquo;s inventory, supplies, equipment, fixtures, and furnishings. Personalized materials which have no value to the franchisor and inventory, supplies, equipment, fixtures, and furnishings not reasonably required in the conduct of the franchise business are not subject to compensation. This subsection applies only if: (i) The term of the franchise is less than 5 years and (ii) the franchisee is prohibited by the franchise or other agreement from continuing to conduct substantially the same business under another trademark, service mark, trade name, logo type, advertising, or other commercial symbol in the same area subsequent to the expiration of the franchise or the franchisee does not receive at least 6 months advance notice of franchisor&rsquo;s intent not to renew the franchise.</p>

<p>(e) A provision that permits the franchisor to refuse to renew a franchise on terms generally available to other franchisees of the same class or type under similar circumstances. This section does not require a renewal provision.</p>

<p>(f) A provision requiring that arbitration or litigation be conducted outside this state. This shall not preclude the franchisee from entering into an agreement, at the time of arbitration, to conduct arbitration at a location outside this state.</p>

<p>(g) A provision which permits a franchisor to refuse to permit a transfer of ownership of a franchise, except for good cause. This subdivision does not prevent a franchisor from exercising a right of first refusal to purchase the franchise. Good cause shall include, but is not limited to: (i) The failure of the proposed transferee to meet the franchisor&rsquo;s then current reasonable qualifications or standards; (ii) The fact that the proposed transferee is a competitor of the franchisor or subfranchisor; (iii) The unwillingness of the proposed transferee to agree in writing to comply with all lawful obligations; (iv) The failure of the franchisee or proposed transferee to pay any sums owing to the franchisor or to cure any default in the franchise agreement existing at the time of the proposed transfer.</p>

<p>(h) A provision that requires the franchisee to resell to the franchisor items that are not uniquely identified with the franchisor. This subdivision does not prohibit a provision that grants to a franchisor a right of first refusal to purchase the assets of a franchise on the same terms and conditions as a bona fide third party willing and able to purchase those assets, nor does this subdivision prohibit a provision that grants the franchisor the right to acquire the assets of a franchise for the market or appraised value of such assets if the franchisee has breached the lawful provisions of the franchise agreement and has failed to cure the breach in the manner provided in subdivision (c).</p>

<p>(i) A provision which permits the franchisor to directly or indirectly convey, assign, or otherwise transfer its obligation to fulfill contractual obligations to the franchisee unless provision has been made for providing the required contractual services.</p>

<p>THE FACT THAT THERE IS A NOTICE OF THIS OFFERING ON FILE WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOES NOT CONSTITUTE APPROVAL, RECOMMENDATION, OR ENDORSEMENT BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.</p>

<p>Any questions regarding this notice should be directed to Department of the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office, Consumer Protection Division, Franchise Section, G. Mennen Williams Building, 525 W. Ottawa Street, Lansing, Michigan 48913; telephone number (517) 373-7117.</p>

The Development Fee is paid in a lump sum at the time the ADA is signed, is uniform to all developers currently acquiring development rights, is not refundable and will not be credited against any other fees paid to us or our affiliates.

<p>3Inventory and Supplies- The opening inventory and supplies will vary based on expected volume of business.</p>

<p>4Computer Hardware, Software, and Phones- You must obtain computer hardware, software, and smart phones to operate this business.</p>

<p>9Professional Fees- You will incur professional fees to set up your entity, assist with this franchise purchase, and the start of your franchised business.</p>

<p>11Total- We do not offer financing directly or indirectly for any part of the initial investment.</p>

<p>B. AREA DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT</p>

<p></p>

<p>Note 1- The low-end comprises of the initial franchise fee of $20,000 plus the $20,000 for the additional two outlets ($10,000 x 2). The high-end comprises of the initial franchise fee of $20,000 plus the $50,000 for the additional four outlets ($10,000 x 4).</p>

<p>Note 2-The low-end comprises of the low-end estimate from the Item 7.A table, less the $20,000 initial franchise fee, as it is included in the Area Development Fee ($42,500 - $20,000 = $22,500). The high-end comprises of the high-end estimate from the Item 7.A table, less the $20,000 initial franchise fee, as it is included in the Area Development Fee ($55,250 - $20,000 = $35,250).</p>

<p>The estimates in this Chart 7(B) assume that you will be entering into an Area Development Agreement for the right to open and operate three to five Franchised Businesses within a Development Area and the cost of opening the first Franchised Business.</p>

<p>The Area Development Fee ranges from $40,000 to $60,000 for three to five territories, as explained in Item 5 above. The Area Development Fee includes the Initial Franchise Fee on the first territory purchased under the Development Agreement and one-half the Initial Franchise Fee on additional territories. You pay the remaining one-half of the Initial Franchise Fee on additional territories at the time you enter into Franchise Agreements for such territories.</p>

<p>This figure represents the total estimated initial investment required to open your initial Franchised Business under the Franchise Agreement you must enter into with us at the same time as the execution of your Development Agreement.</p>

<p>Other than the Development Fee, this figure does not include the costs associated with opening a second and subsequent locations which will incur additional costs.</p>

<p>ITEM 12. TERRITORY</p>

<p>The territory will be for a specific geographic region that we define and approve by radius, zip codes, natural, or political boundaries as set forth in the Franchise Agreement.</p>

<p>A territory will normally include an area of 200,000 households.</p>

<p>We would not normally have occasion to approve relocation of the franchised business because you will work from your home and a vehicle.</p>

<p>We would not normally grant to you approval to open an additional outlet within your territory, but may grant you additional franchise territories if we feel you have the time, energy, capital, and management structure to be able to successfully open and operate another territory.</p>

<p>We do not grant you options, rights of first refusal, or similar rights to acquire additional franchises.</p>

<p>You will receive an exclusive territory, meaning a geographic area within which we promise not to establish either a company-owned or franchised outlet selling the same or similar goods or services under the same or similar trademarks or service marks.</p>

<p>Continuation of your territorial rights does not depend on achieving a certain sales volume, market penetration, or other contingency, and we may not alter your franchise territory, even if there is a population increase in your territory.</p>

<p>We or an affiliate reserves the right to use other channels of distribution, such as the Internet, catalog sales, telemarketing, or other direct marketing sales, to solicit or accept orders within your territory using our principal trademarks, however, we would normally direct inquiries for services from within your territory to your outlet.</p>

<p>We or an affiliate also reserves the right to use other channels of distribution, such as the Internet, catalog sales, telemarketing, or other direct marketing sales, to make sales within your territory of products or services under trademarks different from the ones that you will use under the franchise agreement.</p>

<p>We are not obligated to pay compensation to you for soliciting or accepting orders from inside your territory.</p>

<p>You and other franchisees may not solicit (but may accept) orders from consumers outside of your territory, including through the use of other channels of distribution, such as the Internet, catalog sales, telemarketing, or other direct marketing, but you may engage in internet and social media marketing pursuant to our guidelines which such marketing may extend outside your territory. We also reserve the right to implement cross-territorial protocols and other guidelines applicable to such situations as group advertising buys by multiple franchisees which may extend into multiple territories, solicitation of orders of individuals who may reside in one territory, yet work in another, and other cross-territorial situations. You agree to abide by any such cross-territorial protocols.</p>

<p>Neither we nor an affiliate operates, franchises, or has plans to operate or franchise a business under a different trademark which such business sells or will sell goods or services similar to those you will offer, but we reserve the right to do so.</p>

<p>Area Developers:</p>

<p> Under the Area Development Agreement (the &ldquo;ADA&rdquo;), you will develop, open and operate multiple outlets within a defined Development Area (the &ldquo;Development Area&rdquo;). We determine the Development Area using the same criteria that we use in deciding the Territory for a Business.</p>

<p>ITEM 13. TRADEMARKS</p>

<p>The franchise agreement licenses to you the right to use the following principal trademarks (&ldquo;Marks&rdquo;) registered or applied for with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (&ldquo;USPTO&rdquo;):</p>

<p></p>

<p> We do not have a federal registration for our principal trademark. SERIAL/ REGISTRATION NO. 7036264: PRINCIPAL REGISTER: REGISTRATION DATE, APRIL 25, 2023.</p>

<p>There are no currently effective agreements that significantly limit our rights to use or license the use of our trademarks listed in this section.</p>

<p>There are no currently effective determinations of the USPTO, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, or any state trademark administrator or any court; or any pending infringement, opposition, or cancellation proceeding in which we unsuccessfully sought to prevent registration of a trademark in order to protect a trademark licensed by the franchisor. There is no pending material federal or state court litigation regarding our use or ownership rights in a trademark.</p>

<p>We know of no infringing or prior superior uses that could materially affect the use of the Marks.</p>

<p>You do not receive any rights to the Marks other than the right to use them in the operation of your Franchised Business. You must follow our rules when you use the Marks. You must use the Marks as the sole trade identification of the franchised business. You cannot use any Mark or portion of any Mark as part of any business entity name. You may not use any Mark in connection with the sale of any unauthorized services or products, or in any other manner that we do not authorize in writing. You must obtain a fictitious or assumed name registration if required by your state or local law. Any unauthorized use of the Marks by you is a breach of the Franchise Agreement and an infringement of our rights in the Marks. You must not contest the validity or ownership of the Marks, including any Marks that we license to you after you sign the Franchise Agreement. You must not assist any other person in contesting the validity or ownership of the Marks.</p>

<p>You must immediately notify us in writing when you learn about any claim of infringement, unfair competition, or similar claims about the Marks. You must not communicate with any person other than us and our counsel regarding any infringements, challenges or claims unless you are legally required to do so. However, you may communicate with your own counsel at your own expense. We are not required to take affirmative action when notified of these uses or claims. We have the sole right to control any administrative or judicial proceeding involving a trademark licensed by us. The Franchise Agreement does not require us to participate in your defense or indemnify you for expenses or damages if you are a party to an administrative or judicial proceeding involving a trademark licensed by us to you or if the proceeding is resolved unfavorable to you. You must take any actions that, in the opinion of our counsel, may be advisable to protect and maintain our interests in any proceeding or to otherwise protect and maintain our interests in the Marks.</p>

<p>If we require, you must modify or discontinue the use of any Mark and use other trademarks or service marks we designate. We do not have to reimburse you for modifying or discontinuing the use of a Mark or for substituting another trademark or service mark for a discontinued Mark. If we adopt and use new or modified Marks, you must add or replace equipment, supplies and fixtures, and you must make other modifications we designate as necessary to adapt your franchised business for the new or modified Marks. We do not reimburse you for any loss of goodwill associated with a modified or discontinued Mark.</p>

<p>You must notify us if you apply for your own trademark or service mark registrations. You must not register or seek to register as a trademark or service mark, either with the USPTO or any state or foreign country, any of the Marks or a trademark or service mark that is confusingly similar to any of our Marks.</p>

<p>Periodically, we may allow certain services or products that are not otherwise authorized for general use as a part of the System to be offered locally or regionally based on factors, including test marketing, your qualifications, and regional or local differences.</p>

<p> Franchisor shall be available to render advice, discuss problems, and offer general guidance to Franchisee by telephone and/or electronic correspondence, with respect to planning and operating the Franchised Business. Franchisor shall not charge for this service. Franchisor&rsquo;s advice or guidance to Franchisee relative to prices for products and services that, in Franchisor&rsquo;s judgment, constitutes good business practice is based upon the experience of Franchisor and its franchisees in operating Our Maids businesses and an analysis of costs and prices charged for competitive products and services. Within range, Franchisee shall have the right to change/determine the price to be charged for a particular service by the Franchised Business at the time of sale (if necessary). Notwithstanding, Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that Franchisor shall not be held liable for such advice; any decisions made by Franchisee, whether on its own accord or through suggestion from Franchisor is Franchisee's sole and absolute responsibility.</p>

<p>comply with all other applicable provisions of this Agreement.</p>

<p> 17.2.1 Franchisee acknowledges that the restrictive covenants contained in this Section and in Section 17 are fair and reasonable.</p>

<p> 17.2.2 Except as otherwise approved in writing by Franchisor, neither Franchisee, nor any holder of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisee, nor any officer, director, executive, manager or member of the professional staff of Franchisee, shall, for a period of two (2) years after the expiration or termination of this Agreement, regardless of the cause of termination, either directly or indirectly: offer Competitive Business services located or operating (a) at or within a twenty-five (25) mile radius of the Franchised Business, or (b) within a twenty-five (25) mile radius of any other Our Maids Business in existence at the time of termination or expiration, or (c) any other business owned or operated by the Franchisor in existence at the time of termination or expansion;</p>

<p>solicit or otherwise attempt to induce or influence any customer or other business associate of Franchisor to terminate or modify his, her or its business relationship with Franchisor or to compete against Franchisor; or</p>

<p>17.3 Unfair Competition</p>

<p> If Franchisee operates any other business, Franchisee shall not use any reproduction, counterfeit, copy or colorable imitation of the Marks, either in connection with such other business or the promotion thereof, that is likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception, or that is likely to dilute Franchisor&rsquo;s rights in the Marks. Franchisee shall not utilize any designation of origin, description or representation that falsely suggests or represents an association or connection with Franchisor. This Section is not intended as an approval of Franchisee&rsquo;s right to operate other businesses and in no way is it intended to contradict Sections 17, 17.1 or 17.2. Franchisee shall make such modifications or alterations to the Franchised Business (including changing telephone and facsimile numbers) immediately upon termination or expiration of this Agreement as may be necessary to prevent any association between Franchisor or the System and any business subsequently operated by Franchisee or others at the Franchised Business. Franchisee shall make such specific additional changes to the Franchised Business as Franchisor may reasonably request for that purpose including, without limitation, removal of all physical and structural features identifying or distinctive to the System. If Franchisee fails or refuses to comply with the requirements of this Section, Franchisor has the right to enter upon the Franchised Business for the purpose of making or causing to be made such changes as may be required, at the expense of Franchisee, which expense Franchisee shall pay upon demand.</p>

<p>17.4 Franchisor&rsquo;s Option to Purchase Certain Business Assets</p>

The purchase price shall be equal to the assets&rsquo; book value. If Franchisor elects to exercise this option to purchase, it has the right to set off all amounts due from Franchisee under this Agreement, if any, against the purchase price.</p>

<p>17.5 Survival of Certain Provisions</p>

<p> All obligations of Franchisor and Franchisee, which expressly or by their nature survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement, shall continue in full force and effect subsequent to and notwithstanding their expiration or termination and until satisfied or by their nature expire.</p>

<p>18. TRANSFERABILITY OF INTEREST</p>

<p>18.1 Transfer by Franchisor</p>

<p> This Agreement and all rights and duties hereunder are fully transferable in whole or in part by Franchisor and such rights will inure to the benefit of any person or entity to whom transferred; provided, however, that with respect to any assignment resulting in the subsequent performance by the assignee of the functions of Franchisor, the assignee shall assume the obligations of Franchisor hereunder and Franchisor shall thereafter have no liability for the performance of any obligations contained in this Agreement.</p>

<p>the transferee and, if Franchisor requires, all persons owning any interest in the transferee, have executed the then-current franchise agreement for new franchisees, which may be substantially different from this Agreement, including different Royalty Fee and other material provisions, and the franchise agreement then executed shall be for the term specified in such agreement;</p>

<p>the transferee agrees that it shall complete, to Franchisor&rsquo;s satisfaction, a training program in substance similar to the initial training described in Section 8.1 prior to assuming the management of the day-to-day operation of the Franchised Business.</p>

<p>18.3 Transfer to a Controlled Entity</p>

<p> 18.3.1 If Franchisee wishes to transfer this Agreement or any interest herein to a corporation, limited liability company or other legal entity which shall be entirely owned by Franchisee (&ldquo;Controlled Entity&rdquo;), which Controlled Entity is being formed for the financial planning, tax or other convenience of Franchisee, Franchisor&rsquo;s consent to such transfer shall be conditioned upon the satisfaction of the following requirements:</p>

<p>the Controlled Entity has entered into a written agreement with Franchisor expressly assuming the obligations of this Agreement and all other agreements relating to the operation of the Franchised Business.

<p>copies of the Controlled Entity&rsquo;s articles of incorporation or organization, bylaws, operating agreement, federal tax identification number, and other governing regulations or documents, including resolutions of the board of directors authorizing entry into this Agreement, have been promptly furnished to Franchisor. Any amendment to any such documents shall also be furnished to Franchisor immediately upon adoption.</p>

<p> Franchisor has the right, without liability of any kind or nature whatsoever to Franchisee, to make available for inspection by any intended transferee of Franchisee all or any part of Franchisor&rsquo;s records relating to this Agreement, the Franchised Business or to the history of the relationship of the parties hereto. Franchisee hereby specifically consents to such disclosure by Franchisor and shall release and hold Franchisor harmless from and against any claim, loss or injury resulting from an inspection of Franchisor&rsquo;s records relating to the Franchised Business by an intended transferee identified by Franchisee.</p>

<p>18.5 For-Sale Advertising</p>

<p> Franchisee shall NOT, without prior written consent of Franchisor, place in, on or upon the area of the Franchised Business, or in any communication media, any form of advertising relating to the sale of the Franchised Business or the rights granted hereunder.</p>

<p>18.6 Transfer by Death or Incapacity</p>

<p> Upon the death or Incapacity of Franchisee (if Franchisee is an individual) or any holder of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisee (if Franchisee is a business entity), the appropriate representative of such person (whether administrator, personal representative or trustee) shall, within a reasonable time not exceeding one hundred eighty (180) days following such event, transfer such individual&rsquo;s interest in the Franchised Business or in Franchisee to a third party approved by Franchisor. Such transfers, including transfers by will or inheritance, shall be subject to the conditions for assignments and transfers contained in this Agreement. During such one hundred eighty (180) day period, the Franchised Business must remain at all times under the primary management of a Designated Manager who otherwise meets Franchisor&rsquo;s management qualifications.</p>

<p> Following such a death or Incapacity of such person as described in this Section 18.6, if necessary in Franchisor&rsquo;s discretion, Franchisor shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assume operation of the Franchised Business until the deceased or incapacitated owner&rsquo;s interest is transferred to a third party approved by Franchisor. Franchisor shall be given access to the Franchised Business, even if located within Franchisee&rsquo;s or its Designated Manager&rsquo;s principal residence, and shall not be held liable for trespass or any related tort.

<p>19. RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL</p>

<p>19.1 Submission of Offer</p>

<p> If Franchisee, or any of its owners, proposes to sell or otherwise transfer (including a transfer by death or Incapacity according to Section 18.6) the Franchised Business (or any of its assets outside of the normal course of business), any ownership interest in Franchisee or any ownership interest in the Franchise granted hereunder, Franchisee shall obtain and deliver a bona fide, executed written offer or proposal to purchase, along with all pertinent documents including any contract or due diligence materials, to Franchisor, except with regards to a sale or transfer to a family member. The offer must apply only to an approved sale of the assets or interests listed above and may not include any other property or rights of Franchisee or any of its owners.</p>

<p>19.2 Franchisor&rsquo;s Right to Purchase</p>

<p> Franchisor shall, for thirty (30) days from the date of delivery of all such documents, have the right, exercisable by written notice to Franchisee, to purchase the offered assets or interest for the price and on the same terms and conditions contained in such offer communicated to Franchisee. Franchisor has the right to substitute cash for the fair market value of any form of payment proposed in such offer. Franchisor&rsquo;s credit shall be deemed at least equal to the credit of any proposed buyer. After providing notice to Franchisee of Franchisor&rsquo;s intent to exercise this right of first refusal, Franchisor shall have up to sixty (60) days to close the purchase. Franchisor shall be entitled to receive from Franchisee all customary representations and warranties given by Franchisee as the seller of the assets or such ownership interest or, at Franchisor&rsquo;s election, such representations and warranties contained in the proposal.</p>

<p>19.3 Non-Exercise of Right of First Refusal</p>

<p> If Franchisor does not exercise its right of first refusal within thirty (30) days from the date of delivery of all such documents, the offer or proposal may be accepted by Franchisee or any of its owners, subject to Franchisor&rsquo;s prior written approval as required by Section 18.2. Should the sale fail to close within 120 days after the offer is delivered to Franchisor, Franchisor&rsquo;s right of first refusal shall renew and be implemented in accordance with this Section.</p>

<p>19.4 Sales or Transfers to Family Excepted</p>

<p> If Franchisee proposes to sell or otherwise transfer the Franchised Business (or any of its assets outside of the normal course of business), any ownership interest in Franchisee or any ownership interest in the Franchise granted hereunder to a member of Franchisee&rsquo;s (or its owners&rsquo;) family, then the terms and conditions of this Section shall be inapplicable. Nothing in this Section 19.4 shall be construed to relieve Franchisee from full compliance with the terms and conditions of Section 18.2 prior to a sale or transfer to family according to this Section.</p>

<p>20. BENEFICIAL OWNERS OF FRANCHISEE</p>

<p> Franchisee represents, and Franchisor enters into this Agreement in reliance upon such representation, that the individual(s) identified in Schedule 6 is/are the sole holder(s) of a legal or beneficial interest (in the stated percentages) of Franchisee.</p>

<p>21. RELATIONSHIP AND INDEMNIFICATION</p>

<p>21.1 Relationship</p>

<p> This Agreement is purely a contractual relationship between the parties and does not appoint or make Franchisee an agent, legal representative, joint-venturer, partner, employee, servant, or independent contractor of Franchisor for any purpose whatsoever. Franchisee may not represent or imply to third parties that Franchisee is an agent of Franchisor, and Franchisee is in no way authorized to make any contract, agreement, warranty, or representation on behalf of Franchisor, or to create any obligation, express or implied, on Franchisor&rsquo;s behalf. During the term of this Agreement, and any extension or renewal hereof, Franchisee shall hold itself out to the public only as a franchisee and an owner of the Franchised Business operating the Franchised Business according to a franchise from Franchisor. Franchisee shall take such affirmative action as may be necessary to do so including, without limitation, exhibiting a notice of that fact in a conspicuous place on all forms, stationery or other written materials, the content of which Franchisor has the right to specify. Under no circumstances shall Franchisor be liable for any act, omission, contract, debt, nor any other obligation of Franchisee. Franchisor shall in no way be responsible for any injuries to persons or property resulting from the operation of the Franchised Business by Franchisee. Any third-party contractors and vendors retained by Franchisee to convert or construct the premises are independent contractors of Franchisee alone.</p>

<p>21.2 Standard of Care</p>

<p> This Agreement does not establish a fiduciary relationship between the parties.</p>

<p>21.3 Indemnification</p>

<p> Franchisee shall hold harmless and indemnify Franchisor, any Affiliate, all holders of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisor and all officers, directors, executives, managers, members, partners, owners, employees, agents, successors and assigns (collectively &ldquo;Franchisor Indemnities&rdquo;) from and against all losses, damages, fines, costs, expenses or liability (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and all other costs of litigation) incurred in connection with any action, suit, demand, claim, investigation or proceeding, or any settlement thereof, which arises from or is based upon Franchisee&rsquo;s (a) ownership or operation of the Franchised Business; (b) violation, breach or asserted violation or breach of any federal, state or local law, regulation or rule; (c) breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or provision of this Agreement or any other agreement between Franchisee and Franchisor (or an Affiliate); (d) defamation of Franchisor or the System; (e) acts, errors or omissions committed or incurred in connection with the Franchised Business; or (f) infringement, violation or alleged infringement or violation of any Mark, patent or copyright or any misuse of the Trade Secrets or other Confidential Information. The obligations of this Section 21.3 shall expressly survive the termination of this Agreement.</p>

<p>21.4 Right to Retain Counsel</p>

<p> Franchisee shall give Franchisor immediate notice of any such action, suit, demand, claim, investigation, or proceeding that may give rise to a claim for indemnification by a Franchisor Indemnity. Franchisor has the right to retain counsel of its own choosing in connection with any such action, suit, demand, claim, investigation or proceeding. In order to protect persons, property, Franchisor&rsquo;s reputation or the goodwill of others, Franchisor has the right to, at any time without notice, take such remedial or corrective actions as it deems expedient with respect to any action, suit, demand, claim, investigation or proceeding if, in Franchisor&rsquo;s sole judgment, there are grounds to believe any of the acts or circumstances listed above have occurred. If Franchisor&rsquo;s exercise of its rights under this Section causes any of Franchisee&rsquo;s insurers to refuse to pay a third-party claim, all cause of action and legal remedies Franchisee might have against such insurer shall automatically be assigned to Franchisor without the need for any further action on either party&rsquo;s part. Under no circumstances shall Franchisor be required or obligated to seek coverage from third parties or otherwise mitigate losses in order to maintain a claim against Franchisee. The failure to pursue such remedy or mitigate such loss shall in no way reduce the amounts recoverable by Franchisor from Franchisee. Franchisee agrees to not be a party to class action suit against the Franchisor or any of its Affiliates under any circumstances.</p>

<p>22. GENERAL CONDITIONS AND PROVISIONS</p>

<p>22.1 No Waiver</p>

<p> No failure of Franchisor to exercise any power reserved to it hereunder, or to insist upon strict compliance by Franchisee with any obligation or condition hereunder, and no custom nor practice of the parties in variance with the terms hereof, shall constitute a waiver of Franchisor&rsquo;s right to demand exact compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Waiver by Franchisor of any particular default by Franchisee shall not be binding unless in writing and executed by Franchisor and shall not affect nor impair Franchisor&rsquo;s right with respect to any subsequent default of the same or of a different nature. Subsequent acceptance by Franchisor of any payment(s) due shall not be deemed to be a waiver by Franchisor of any preceding breach by Franchisee of any terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement.</p>

<p>22.2 Injunctive Relief</p>

<p> As any breach by Franchisee of any of the restrictions contained in Sections 6, 7, and 17 would result in irreparable injury to Franchisor, and as the damages arising out of any such breach would be difficult to ascertain, in addition to all other remedies provided by law or in equity, Franchisor shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief (whether a restraining order, a preliminary injunction or a permanent injunction) against any such breach, whether actual or contemplated, without the necessity of posting security or bond and Franchisee shall be responsible for Franchisor&rsquo;s reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees incurred in pursuing the same. Franchisor&rsquo;s right to seek injunctive relief will not affect the parties&rsquo; waiver of jury trial and covenant to arbitrate all disputes in accordance with Section 23.7. Franchisor&rsquo;s rights herein shall include pursuing injunctive relief through arbitration or in a state or federal court.</p>

<p>22.3 Notices</p>

<p> All notices required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed received: (a) at the time delivered by hand to the recipient party (or to an officer, director or partner of the recipient party); (b) on the next business day after transmission by facsimile or other reasonably reliable electronic communication system; (c) two (2) business days after being sent via guaranteed overnight delivery by a commercial courier service; or (d) five (5) business days after being sent by Registered Mail, return receipt requested. Either party may change its address by a written notice sent in accordance with this Section 22.3. All notices, payments and reports required by this Agreement shall be sent to Franchisor at the following address, or at such other address as Franchisor may provide:</p>

<p>22.4 Cost of Enforcement or Defense</p>

<p> If Franchisor is required to enforce this Agreement in a judicial or arbitration proceeding, if it is the prevailing party, it shall be entitled to reimbursement of its costs, including reasonable accounting and attorneys&rsquo; fees, in connection with such proceeding.</p>

<p>22.5 Unlimited Guaranty and Assumption of Obligations</p>

<p> All holders of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisee of five percent (5%) or greater shall be required to execute, as of the date of this Agreement, the Unlimited Guaranty and Assumption of Obligations attached as Schedule 3, through which such holders agree to assume and discharge all of Franchisee&rsquo;s obligations under this Agreement and to be personally liable hereunder for all of the same.</p>

<p>22.6 Approvals</p>

<p> Whenever this Agreement requires the prior approval or consent of Franchisor, Franchisee shall make a timely written request to Franchisor for such approval and, except as otherwise provided herein, any approval or consent granted shall be effective only if in writing. Franchisor makes no warranties or guarantees upon which Franchisee may rely, and assumes no liability or obligation to Franchisee or any third party to which it would not otherwise be subject, by providing any waiver, approval, advice, consent or services to Franchisee in connection with this Agreement, or by reason of any neglect, delay or denial of any request for approval.</p>

<p>22.7 Entire Agreement</p>

<p> This Agreement and all exhibits to this Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties and supersede any and all prior negotiations, understandings, representations, and agreements. Nothing in this or in any related agreement, however, is intended to disclaim the representations we made in the franchise disclosure document that we furnished to you. No amendment, change or variance from this Agreement shall be binding on either party unless executed in writing by both parties.</p>

<p>22.8 Severability and Modification</p>

<p> Except as noted below, each paragraph, part, term and provision of this Agreement shall be considered severable. If any paragraph, part, term or provision herein is ruled to be unenforceable, unreasonable or invalid, such ruling shall not impair the operation of or affect the remaining portions, paragraphs, parts, terms and provisions of this Agreement, and the latter shall continue to be given full force and effect and bind the parties; and such unenforceable, unreasonable or invalid paragraphs, parts, terms or provisions shall be deemed not part of this Agreement.</p>

<p> Notwithstanding the above, each of the covenants contained in Sections 7 and 17 shall be construed as independent of any other covenant or provision of this Agreement. If all or any portion of any such covenant is held to be unenforceable, unreasonable, or invalid, then it shall be amended to provide for limitations on disclosure of Trade Secrets or other Confidential Information or on competition to the maximum extent provided or permitted by law.</p>

<p>22.9 Construction</p>

<p> All captions herein are intended solely for the convenience of the parties, and none shall be deemed to affect the meaning or construction of any provision hereof.</p>

<p>22.10 Force Majeure</p>

<p> Whenever a period of time is provided in this Agreement for either party to perform any act, except pay monies, neither party shall be liable nor responsible for any delays due to strikes, lockouts, casualties, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental regulation or control or other causes beyond the reasonable control of the parties, and the time period for the performance of such act shall be extended for the amount of time of the delay. This clause shall not result in an extension of the term of this Agreement.</p>

<p>22.11 Timing</p>

<p> Time is of the essence. Except as in Section 22.10, failure to perform any act within the time required or permitted by this Agreement shall be a material breach.</p>

<p>22.12 Withholding Payments</p>

<p> Franchisee shall not, for any reason, withhold payment of any Royalty Fees or other amounts due to Franchisor or to an Affiliate. Franchisee shall not withhold or offset any amounts, damages or other monies allegedly due to Franchisee against any amounts due to Franchisor. No endorsement or statement on any payment for less than the full amount due to Franchisor will be construed as an acknowledgment of payment in full, or an accord and satisfaction, and Franchisor has the right to accept and cash any such payment without prejudice to Franchisor&rsquo;s right to recover the full amount due, or pursue any other remedy provided in this Agreement or by law. Franchisor has the right to apply any payments made by Franchisee against any of Franchisee&rsquo;s past due indebtedness as Franchisor deems appropriate. Franchisor shall set off sums Franchisor owes to Franchisee against any unpaid debts owed by Franchisee to Franchisor.</p>

<p>22.13 Further Assurances</p>

<p> Each party to this Agreement will execute and deliver such further instruments, contracts, forms or other documents, and will perform such further acts, as may be necessary or desirable to perform or complete any term, covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement.</p>

<p>22.14 Third Party Beneficiaries</p>

<p> Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, nothing in this Agreement is intended, nor shall be deemed, to confer upon any person or legal entity other than Franchisor or Franchisee, and their respective successors and assigns as may be contemplated by this Agreement, any rights or remedies under this Agreement.</p>

<p>22.15 Multiple Originals</p>

<p> Both parties will execute multiple copies of this Agreement, and each executed copy will be deemed an original.</p>

<p>23. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</p>

<p>23.1 Choice of Law</p>

<p> Except as to claims governed by federal law, Delaware law governs all claims that in any way relate to or arise out of this Agreement or any of the dealings of the parties (&ldquo;Claims&rdquo;). However, no laws regulating the sale of franchises or governing the relationship between franchisor and franchisee shall apply unless the jurisdictional requirements of such laws are met independently of this paragraph.</p>

<p>23.2 Jurisdiction and Venue</p>

<p> You and we agree that venue and jurisdiction for any Claims, except those required to be submitted to arbitration, shall be proper solely in the state and federal court nearest to our corporate headquarters, presently located in Dover, Delaware. However, if you are an Illinois, Maryland, or Washington State resident or your franchise territory is located in Illinois, Maryland, or Washington State, you agree to bring any Claims, if at all, solely in arbitration before the American Arbitration Association in the city or county where our corporate headquarters are located.</p>

<p>23.3 Jury Waiver</p>

<p> In any trial between any of the parties as to any Claims, you and we agree to waive our rights to a jury trial and instead have such action tried by a judge.</p>

<p>23.4 Class Action Waiver</p>

<p> You agree to bring any Claims, if at all, individually and you shall not join such claim with claims of any other person or entity or bring, join or participate in a class action against us.</p>

<p>23.5 Limitation of Damages</p>

<p> Franchisee and Franchisor each waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any right or claim for any punitive or exemplary damages against the other and agree that if there is a dispute with the other, each will be limited to the recovery of actual damages sustained by it including reasonable accounting and legal fees as provided in Section 22.4. Franchisee waives and disclaims any right to consequential damages in any action or claim against Franchisor concerning this Agreement or any related agreement. In any claim or action brought by Franchisee against Franchisor concerning this Agreement, Franchisee&rsquo;s contract damages shall not exceed and shall be limited to refund of Franchisee&rsquo;s Franchise Fee and Royalty Fees.</p>

<p>23.6 Limitation of Actions  You agree to bring any Claims against us, if at all, within one (1) year of the occurrence of the facts giving rise to such Claims, and that any action not brought within this period shall be barred as a claim, counterclaim, defense, or set-off.</p>

<p>23.7 Prior Notice of Claims</p>

<p> As a condition precedent to commencing an action for a Claim, you must notify us within thirty (30) days after the occurrence of the violation or breach, and failure to timely give such notice shall preclude any claim for damages.</p>

<p>23.8 Internal Dispute Resolution</p>

<p> You must first bring any Claim to our CEO, after providing notice as in Section 23.7 above. You must exhaust this internal dispute resolution procedure before you may bring your Claim before a third party.</p>

<p>23.9 Mediation and Arbitration</p>

<p> Before you may bring any Claim against us, you agree to try for a period of 60 days to mediate such claim before a mutually agreed to mediator in the city or county where our headquarters are located. If we cannot mutually agree on a mediator, you and we agree to use the mediation services of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), and split any AAA and mediator fees equally.</p>

<p> If mediation is unsuccessful and you decide to pursue a legal claim against us, you agree to bring such claim solely in binding arbitration conducted in the city or county where our headquarters is located, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. The proceedings will be held by a single arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding upon the parties. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having personal and subject matter jurisdiction.</p>

<p>23.10 Waiver of Bond</p>

<p>You agree that if we are forced to bring suit to enforce any provision of this Agreement, you agree to waive any requirement that we post bond to obtain a temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunction to enforce these duties.</p>

<p>23.11 Attorney Fees</p>

<p> If we are the substantially prevailing party as to any Claims, you agree to reimburse our costs and attorney fees incurred in pursuing or defending the Claims.</p>

<p>23.12 Third Party Beneficiaries</p>

<p>Our officers, directors, members, shareholders, agents, and employees are express third-party beneficiaries of the terms of the Dispute Resolution provisions contained herein.</p>

<p> Title:   __ SCHEDULE 2 TO THE FRANCHISE AGREEMENT NONDISCLOSURE AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT</p>

<p> This &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo; made as of the  _ day of     _, 20 _, is by and between      , (&ldquo;Franchisee,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us,&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) and        (&ldquo;Individual,&rdquo; &ldquo;you,&rdquo; or &ldquo;your&rdquo;).</p>

<p>W I T N E S S E T H:</p>

<p> WHEREAS, Franchisee is a party to that certain Franchise Agreement dated      , 20__ (&ldquo;Franchise Agreement&rdquo;) by and between Franchisee and the Franchisor, Our Maids Franchise, Inc. (&ldquo;Company&rdquo;); and</p>

<p> WHEREAS, Franchisee desires Individual to have access to and review certain Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information, which are more particularly described below; and</p>

<p> WHEREAS, Franchisee is required by the Franchise Agreement to have Individual execute this Agreement prior to providing Individual access to said Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information; and   WHEREAS, Individual understands the necessity of not disclosing any such information to any other party or using such information to compete against Company, Franchisee or any other franchisee of Company in any business (i) that offers or provides (or grants franchises or licenses to others to operate a business that offers or provides) products and services the same as or similar to those provided by Franchisee or (ii) in which Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information (as defined below) could be used to the disadvantage of Franchisee, or Company, any affiliate of Company or Company&rsquo;s other franchisees (hereinafter, &ldquo;Competitive Business&rdquo;); provided, however, that the term &ldquo;Competitive Business&rdquo; shall not apply to any business operated by Franchisee under a Franchise Agreement with Company.</p>

<p> NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and undertakings stated here, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereby mutually agree as follows:</p>

<p> 1. Trade Secrets and Confidential Information</p>

<p> Individual understands Franchisee possesses and will possess Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information that are important to its business.</p>

<p> a) For the purposes of this Agreement, a &ldquo;Trade Secret&rdquo; is information in any form (including, but not limited to, materials and techniques, technical or non-technical data, formulas, patterns, recipes compilations, programs, devices, methods, techniques, drawings, processes, financial data, financial plans, product plans, passwords, lists of actual or potential customers or suppliers) related to or used in the Our Maids Business that is not commonly known by or available to the public and that information: (i) derives economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (ii) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.</p>

<p> b) For the purposes of this Agreement &ldquo;Confidential Information&rdquo; means technical and non-technical information used in or related to Our Maids that is not commonly known by or available to the public, including, without limitation, Trade Secrets and information contained in the Operations Manual and training guides and materials. In addition, any other information identified as confidential when delivered by Franchisee shall be deemed Confidential Information. Confidential Information shall not include, however, any information that: (i) is now or subsequently becomes generally available to the public through no fault of Individual; (ii) Individual can demonstrate was rightfully in its possession, without obligation of nondisclosure, prior to disclosure according to this Agreement; (iii) is independently developed without the use of any Confidential Information; or (iv) is rightfully obtained from a third party who has the right, without obligation of nondisclosure, to transfer or disclose such information.</p>

<p> c) Any information expressly designated by Company or Franchisee as &ldquo;Trade Secrets&rdquo; or &ldquo;Confidential Information&rdquo; shall be deemed such for all purposes of this Agreement, but the absence of designation shall not relieve Individual of his or her obligations hereunder in respect of information otherwise constituting Trade Secrets or Confidential Information. Individual understands Franchisee&rsquo;s providing of access to the Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information creates a relationship of confidence and trust between Individual and Franchisee with respect to the Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information.</p>

<p> 2. Confidentiality/Non-Disclosure</p>

<p> a) Individual shall not communicate or divulge to (or use for the benefit of) any other person, firm, association, or corporation, with the sole exception of Franchisee, now or at any time in the future, any Trade Secrets or other Confidential Information. At all times from the date of this Agreement, Individual must take all steps reasonably necessary and/or requested by Franchisee to ensure that the Confidential Information and Trade Secrets are kept confidential according to the terms of this Agreement. Individual must comply with all applicable policies, procedures and practices that Franchisee has established and may establish from time to time with regard to the Confidential Information and Trade Secrets.</p>

<p> b) Individual&rsquo;s obligations under paragraph 2(a) of this Agreement shall continue in effect after termination of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee, regardless of the reason or reasons for termination, and whether such termination is voluntary or involuntary, and Franchisee is entitled to communicate Individual&rsquo;s obligations under this Agreement to any future customer or employer to the extent deemed necessary by Franchisee for protection of its rights hereunder and regardless of whether Individual or any of its affiliates or assigns becomes an investor, partner, joint venturer, broker, distributor or the like in an Our Maids Business.</p>

<p> 3. Non-Competition</p>

<p> a) During the term of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee and for a period of two (2) years after the expiration or termination of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee, regardless of the cause of expiration or termination, Individual shall not, directly or indirectly, divert or attempt to divert any business or customer of Franchisee or the Company to any Competitive Business, by direct or indirect inducement or otherwise, or do or perform, directly or indirectly, any other act injurious or prejudicial to the goodwill associated with the Company&rsquo;s service mark &ldquo;Our Maids&rdquo; and such other trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, designs, graphics, logos, emblems, insignia, fascia, slogans, drawings and other commercial symbols as the Company designates to be used in connection with Our Maids or the Company&rsquo;s uniform standards, methods, procedures and specifications for the establishment and operation of an Our Maids business.     b) During the term of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, regardless of the cause of termination, Individual shall not, directly or indirectly, offer Competitive Business services anywhere within a TWENTY FIVE (25) mile radius of any Our Maids location without the express written consent of Franchisee and the Company.</p>

<p> c) During the term of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, regardless of the cause of termination, Individual shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit or otherwise attempt to induce or influence any business associate of Franchisee, Company or any other Our Maids Business to compete against, or terminate or modify his, her or its business relationship with, Franchisee, Company or any other Our Maids Business.</p>

<p> 4. Reasonableness of Restrictions</p>

<p> Individual acknowledges that each of the terms stated here, including the restrictive covenants, is fair and reasonable and is reasonably required for the protection of Franchisee, Company, and Company&rsquo;s Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information, the Company&rsquo;s business system, network of franchises and trade and service marks, and Individual waives any right to challenge these restrictions as being overly broad, unreasonable or otherwise unenforceable. If, however, a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any such restriction is unreasonable or unenforceable, then Individual shall submit to the reduction of any such activity, time period or geographic restriction necessary to enable the court to enforce such restrictions to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. It is the desire and intent of the parties that the provisions of this Agreement shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies applied in any jurisdiction where enforcement is sought.</p>

<p> 5. Relief for Breaches of Confidentiality, Non-Solicitation, and Non-Competition</p>

<p> Individual further acknowledges that an actual or threatened violation of the covenants contained in this Agreement will cause Franchisee and Company immediate and irreparable harm, damage and injury that cannot be fully compensated for by an award of damages or other remedies at law. Accordingly, Franchisee and/or Company shall be entitled, as a matter of right, to an injunction from any court of competent jurisdiction restraining any further violation by Individual of this Agreement without any requirement to show any actual damage or to post any bond or other security. Such right to an injunction shall be cumulative and in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights and remedies that Franchisee and Company may have at law or in equity.</p>

<p> 6. Dispute Resolution</p>

<p> a) Choice of Law. Except as to claims governed by federal law, the local law where the Franchised Business is located governs all claims that in any way relate to or arise out of this Agreement or any of the dealings of the parties (&ldquo;Claims&rdquo;). However, no laws regulating the sale of franchises or governing the relationship between franchisor and franchisee shall apply unless the jurisdictional requirements of such laws are met independently of this paragraph.</p>

<p> b) Jurisdiction and Venue. You and we agree that venue and jurisdiction for any Claims, except those required to be submitted to arbitration, shall be proper solely in the state and federal court nearest to our corporate headquarters.</p>

<p> c) Jury Waiver. In any trial between any of the parties as to any Claims, you and we agree to waive our rights to a jury trial and instead have such action tried by a judge.</p>

<p> d) Class Action Waiver. You agree to bring any Claims, if at all, individually and you shall not join such claim with claims of any other person or entity or bring, join or participate in a class action against us.  e) Punitive Damages Waiver. As to any Claims, you and we agree to waive our rights, if any, to seek or recover punitive damages.</p>

<p> f) Limitation of Actions. You agree to bring any Claims against us, if at all, within one (1) year of the occurrence of the facts giving rise to such Claims, and that any action not brought within this period shall be barred as a claim, counterclaim, defense, or set-off.</p>

<p>g) Prior Notice of Claims. As a condition precedent to commencing an action for a Claim, you must notify us within thirty (30) days after the occurrence of the violation or breach, and failure to timely give such notice shall preclude any claim for damages.</p>

<p>h) Internal Dispute Resolution. You must first bring any Claim to our CEO, after providing notice as in Section 6(g) above. You must exhaust this internal dispute resolution procedure before you may bring your Claim before a third party.</p>

<p> i) Mediation and Arbitration. Before you may bring any Claim against us court, you agree to try for a period of 60 days to mediate such claim before a mutually agreed to mediator in the city or county where our headquarters are located. If we cannot mutually agree on a mediator, you and we agree to use the mediation services of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), and split any AAA and mediator fees equally.</p>

<p> If mediation is unsuccessful and you decide to pursue a legal claim against us, you agree to bring such claim solely in binding arbitration conducted in the city or county of our headquarters in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. The proceedings will be held by a single arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding upon the parties. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having personal and subject matter jurisdiction.</p>

<p>j) Waiver of Bond. You agree that if we are forced to bring suit to enforce any provision of this Agreement, you agree to waive any requirement that we post bond to obtain a temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunction to enforce these duties.</p>

<p>k) Attorney Fees. If we are the substantially prevailing party as to any Claims, you agree to reimburse our costs and attorney fees incurred in pursuing or defending the Claims.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>1. Use. Tenant is a franchisee of Franchisor. The Leased Premises shall be used only for the operation of an Our Maids business (or any name authorized by Franchisor).</p>

<p>2. Notice of Default and Opportunity To Cure. Landlord shall provide Franchisor with copies of any written notice of default (&ldquo;Default&rdquo;) given to Tenant under the Lease, and Landlord grants to Franchisor the option (but not the obligation) to cure any Default under the Lease (should Tenant fail to do so) within 10 days after the expiration of the period in which Tenant may cure the Default.</p>

<p>3. Termination of Lease. Landlord shall copy Franchisor on any notice of termination of the Lease. If Landlord terminates the Lease for Tenant&rsquo;s Default, Franchisor shall have the option to enter into a new Lease with Landlord on the same terms and conditions as the terminated Lease, subject to Landlord&rsquo;s approval in its reasonable discretion. To exercise this option, Franchisor must notify Landlord within 10 days after Franchisor receives notice of the termination of the Lease.</p>

<p>4. Termination of Franchise Agreement. If the Franchise Agreement between Franchisor and Tenant is terminated during the term of the Lease, then upon the written request of Franchisor, Landlord and Tenant consent to allow Franchisor to assume any existing term of the Lease (the &ldquo;Assumption&rdquo;), provided that any and all defaults have been cured and all payments due under the Lease are current, and to enter into a written agreement providing for such Assumption. In the event of an Assumption, Landlord will deliver possession of the Leased Premises to Franchisor free and clear of any rights of the Tenant or any third party. Landlord further consents to give Franchisor the right, following the Assumption, to assign its interest in the Lease or to sublet the Leased Premises to another franchisee of Franchisor with reasonable consent from the Landlord.</p>

<p>5. Assignment and Subletting. Notwithstanding any provision of the Lease to the contrary, Tenant shall have the right to assign or sublet the Lease to Franchisor, provided that no such assignment or sublease shall relieve Tenant or any guarantor of liability under the Lease. If Franchisor becomes the lessee of the Leased Premises, then Franchisor shall have the right to assign or sublease its lease to a franchisee of Franchisor&rsquo;s brand, subject to Landlord&rsquo;s approval in its reasonable discretion.</p>

<p>6. Authorization. Tenant authorizes Landlord and Franchisor to communicate directly with each other about Tenant and Tenant&rsquo;s business.</p>

<p>7. Right to Enter. Upon the expiration or termination of the Franchise Agreement or the Lease, or the termination of Tenant&rsquo;s right of possession of the Leased Premises, Franchisor or its designee may, after giving reasonable prior notice to Landlord, enter the Leased Premises within 10 days of such expiration or termination, to take any such actions as may be consistent with its rights under this Lease Addendum or to remove signs and other material bearing Franchisor&rsquo;s brand name, trademarks, and commercial symbols.</p>

<p>8. No Liability. By executing this Addendum, Franchisor does not assume any liability with respect to the Leased Premises or any obligation as Tenant under the Lease.</p>

<p> 1. Any claims arising under the Maryland Franchise Registration and Disclosure Law must be brought within 3 years after the grant of the franchise.</p>

<p> 2. A general release required as a condition of renewal, sale, and/or assignment/transfer shall not apply to any liability under the Maryland Franchise Registration and Disclosure Law.</p>

<p>If any of the terms of the Franchise Agreement are inconsistent with the terms below, the terms below control.</p>

<p>Minn. Stat. &sect;80C.21 and Minn. Rule 2860.4400(J) prohibit the franchisor from requiring litigation to be conducted outside Minnesota, requiring waiver of a jury trial, or requiring the franchisee to consent to liquidated damages, termination penalties or judgment notes. In addition, nothing in the Franchise Disclosure Document or agreements can abrogate or reduce (1) any of the franchisee&rsquo;s rights as provided for in Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 80C, or (2) franchisee&rsquo;s rights to any procedure, forum, or remedies provided for by the laws of the jurisdiction.</p>

<p>With respect to franchises governed by Minnesota law, the franchisor will comply with Minn. Stat. Sec. 80C.14 Subds. 3, 4, and 5 which require (except in certain specified cases), that a franchisee be given 90 days&rsquo; notice of termination (with 60 days to cure) and 180 days&rsquo; notice for non-renewal of the franchise agreement and that consent to the transfer of the franchise will not be unreasonably withheld.</p>

<p>The franchisor will protect the franchisee&rsquo;s rights to use the trademarks, service marks, trade names, logotypes or other commercial symbols or indemnify the franchisee from any loss, costs or expenses arising out of any claim, suit or demand regarding the use of the name.</p>

<p>Minnesota considers it unfair to not protect the franchisee&rsquo;s right to use the trademarks. Refer to Minnesota Statutes 80C.12, Subd. 1(g).</p>

<p>Minnesota Rules 2860.4400(D) prohibits a franchisor from requiring a franchisee to assent to a general release.</p>

<p>The franchisee cannot consent to the franchisor obtaining injunctive relief. The franchisor may seek injunctive relief. See Minn. Rules 2860.4400J.</p>

<p>Also, a court will determine if a bond is required.</p>

<p>Any Limitations of Claims section must comply with Minnesota Statutes, Section 80C.17, Subd. 5.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON ADDENDUM TO THE FRANCHISE AGREEMENT</p>

<p>If any of the terms of the Franchise Agreement are inconsistent with the terms below, the terms below control.</p>

<p>In the event of a conflict of laws, the provisions of the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, Chapter 19.100 RCW will prevail.</p>

<p>RCW 19.100.180 may supersede the franchise agreement in your relationship with the franchisor including the areas of termination and renewal of your franchise. There may also be court decisions which may supersede the franchise agreement in your relationship with the franchisor including the areas of termination and renewal of your franchise.</p>

<p>In any arbitration or mediation involving a franchise purchased in Washington, the arbitration or mediation site will be either in the state of Washington, or in a place mutually agreed upon at the time of the arbitration or mediation, or as determined by the arbitrator or mediator at the time of arbitration or mediation. In addition, if litigation is not precluded by the franchise agreement, a franchisee may bring an action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with the sale of franchises, or a violation of the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, in Washington.</p>

<p>A release or waiver of rights executed by a franchisee may not include rights under the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act or any rule or order thereunder except when executed pursuant to a negotiated settlement after the agreement is in effect and where the parties are represented by independent counsel. Provisions such as those which unreasonably restrict or limit the statute of limitations period for claims under the Act, or rights or remedies under the Act such as a right to a jury trial, may not be enforceable.</p>

<p>Transfer fees are collectable to the extent that they reflect the franchisor&rsquo;s reasonable estimated or actual costs in effecting a transfer.</p>

<p>Pursuant to RCW 49.62.020, a noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable against an employee, including an employee of a franchisee, unless the employee&rsquo;s earnings from the party seeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed $100,000 per year (an amount that will be adjusted annually for inflation). In addition, a noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable against an independent contractor of a franchisee under RCW 49.62.030 unless the independent contractor&rsquo;s earnings from the party seeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed $250,000 per year (an amount that will be adjusted annually for inflation). As a result, any provisions contained in the franchise agreement or elsewhere that conflict with these limitations are void and unenforceable in Washington.</p>

<p>RCW 49.62.060 prohibits a franchisor from restricting, restraining, or prohibiting a franchisee from (i) soliciting or hiring any employee of a franchisee of the same franchisor or (ii) soliciting or hiring any employee of the franchisor. As a result, any such provisions contained in the franchise agreement or elsewhere are void and unenforceable in Washington.</p>

<p>Section 17.2.2(a) is modified to also provide that the post-term non-compete will only apply to a 25 mile radius of your Franchised Business.</p>

<p>Section 21.3 is modified to also provide that the indemnification does not extend to liabilities resulting from the gross negligence of willful misconduct of any Franchisor indemnitee.</p>

<p>The Franchise Agreement is amended to also include the following language:</p>

<p>With respect to franchises governed by Wisconsin law, the Wisconsin Fair Dealership Law applies to most, if not all, franchise agreements and prohibits the termination, cancellation, non-renewal or the substantial change of the competitive circumstances of a dealership agreement without good cause. That Law further provides that 90 days&rsquo; prior written notice of a proposed termination, etc. must be given to the dealer. The dealer has 60 days to cure the deficiency and if the deficiency is cured, the notice is void.</p>

<p>Minnesota considers it unfair to not protect the franchisee&rsquo;s right to use the trademarks. Refer to Minnesota Statutes 80C.12, Subd. 1(g).</p>

<p>Minnesota Rules 2860.4400(D) prohibits a franchisor from requiring a franchisee to assent to a general release.</p>

<p>The franchisee cannot consent to the franchisor obtaining injunctive relief. The franchisor may seek injunctive relief. See Minn. Rules 2860.4400J.</p>

<p>Also, a court will determine if a bond is required.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON ADDENDUM TO THE AREA DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT</p>

<p>As to franchises governed by the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, if any of the terms of the Disclosure Document are inconsistent with the terms below, the terms below control.</p>

<p>In the event of a conflict of laws, the provisions of the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, Chapter 19.100 RCW will prevail.</p>

<p>RCW 19.100.180 may supersede the franchise agreement in your relationship with the franchisor including the areas of termination and renewal of your franchise. There may also be court decisions which may supersede the franchise agreement in your relationship with the franchisor including the areas of termination and renewal of your franchise.</p>

<p>In any arbitration or mediation involving a franchise purchased in Washington, the arbitration or mediation site will be either in the state of Washington, or in a place mutually agreed upon at the time of the arbitration or mediation, or as determined by the arbitrator or mediator at the time of arbitration or mediation. In addition, if litigation is not precluded by the franchise agreement, a franchisee may bring an action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with the sale of franchises, or a violation of the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, in Washington.</p>

<p>A release or waiver of rights executed by a franchisee may not include rights under the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act or any rule or order thereunder except when executed pursuant to a negotiated settlement after the agreement is in effect and where the parties are represented by independent counsel. Provisions such as those which unreasonably restrict or limit the statute of limitations period for claims under the Act, or rights or remedies under the Act such as a right to a jury trial, may not be enforceable.</p>

<p>Transfer fees are collectable to the extent that they reflect the franchisor&rsquo;s reasonable estimated or actual costs in effecting a transfer.</p>

<p>Pursuant to RCW 49.62.020, a noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable against an employee, including an employee of a franchisee, unless the employee&rsquo;s earnings from the party seeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed $100,000 per year (an amount that will be adjusted annually for inflation). In addition, a noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable against an independent contractor of a franchisee under RCW 49.62.030 unless the independent contractor&rsquo;s earnings from the party seeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed $250,000 per year (an amount that will be adjusted annually for inflation). As a result, any provisions contained in the franchise agreement or elsewhere that conflict with these limitations are void and unenforceable in Washington.</p>

<p>RCW 49.62.060 prohibits a franchisor from restricting, restraining, or prohibiting a franchisee from (i) soliciting or hiring any employee of a franchisee of the same franchisor or (ii) soliciting or hiring any employee of the franchisor. As a result, any such provisions contained in the franchise agreement or elsewhere are void and unenforceable in Washington.</p>

<p>A release or waiver of rights signed by the franchisee shall not include rights under the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act except when executed according to a negotiated settlement after the agreement is in effect and where the parties are represented by independent counsel. Provisions such as those that unreasonably restrict or limit the statute of limitations period for claims under the Act, rights or remedies under the Act such as a right to a jury trial may not be enforceable.</p>

<p>In any arbitration or mediation involving a franchise purchased in Washington, the arbitration or mediation site will be either in the state of Washington, or in a place mutually agreed upon at the time of the arbitration or mediation, or as determined by the arbitrator or mediator at the time of arbitration or mediation.

That Law further provides that 90 days&rsquo; prior written notice of a proposed termination, etc. must be given to the dealer.

<p>Buying a franchise is a complex investment. The information in this disclosure document can help you make up your mind.

You can contact the FTC at 1-877-FTC-HELP or by writing to the FTC at 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580.

<p>Issuance Date: March 20, 2023</p>

<p>How to Use This Franchise Disclosure Document</p>

<p>Here are some questions you may be asking about buying a franchise and tips on how to find more information:</p>

<p>What You Need To Know About Franchising Generally</p>

<p>Continuing responsibility to pay fees. You may have to pay royalties and other fees even if you are losing money.    Business model can change. The franchise agreement may allow the franchisor to change its manuals and business model without your consent. These changes may require you to make additional investments in your franchise business or may harm your franchise business.    Supplier restrictions. You may have to buy or lease items from the franchisor or a limited group of suppliers the franchisor designates. These items may be more expensive than similar items you could buy on your own.    Operating restrictions. The franchise agreement may prohibit you from operating a similar business during the term of the franchise. There are usually other restrictions. Some examples may include controlling your location, your access to customers, what you sell, how you market, and your hours of operation.    Competition from franchisor. Even if the franchise agreement grants you a territory, the franchisor may have the right to compete with you in your territory.    Renewal. Your franchise agreement may not permit you to renew. Even if it does, you may have to sign a new agreement with different terms and conditions in order to continue to operate your franchise business.    When your franchise ends. The franchise agreement may prohibit you from operating a similar business after your franchise ends even if you still have obligations to your landlord or other creditors.    Some States Require Registration   Your state may have a franchise law, or other law, that requires franchisors to register before offering or selling franchises in the state. Registration does not mean that the state recommends the franchise or has verified the information in this document. To find out if your state has a registration requirement, or to contact your state, use the agency information in Exhibit A.    Your state also may have laws that require special disclosures or amendments be made to your franchise agreement. If so, you should check the State Specific Addenda. See the Table of Contents for the location of the State Specific Addenda.  </p>

<p>Special Risks to Consider About This Franchise   Certain states require that the following risk(s) be highlighted:     1. Out-of-State Dispute Resolution. The franchise agreement requires you to resolve disputes with the franchisor by mediation, arbitration and/or litigation only in Delaware. Out-of-state mediation, arbitration, or litigation may force you to accept a less favorable settlement for disputes. It may also cost more to mediate, arbitrate, or litigate with the franchisor in Delaware than in your own state.</p>

<p> 2. Short Operating History. The franchisor is at an early stage of development and has a limited operating history. This franchise is likely to be a riskier investment than a franchise in a system with a longer operating history.</p>

<p> 3. Financial Condition. The Franchisor&rsquo;s financial condition as reflected in its financial statements (see Item 21) calls into question the Franchisor&rsquo;s financial ability to provide services and support to you.</p>

<p>Certain states may require other risks to be highlighted. Check the &ldquo;State Specific Addenda&rdquo; (if any) to see whether your state requires other risks to be highlighted.</p>

<p>MICHIGAN ADDENDUM TO THE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT</p>

<p>THE STATE OF MICHIGAN PROHIBITS CERTAIN UNFAIR PROVISIONS THAT ARE SOMETIMES IN FRANCHISE DOCUMENTS. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS ARE IN THESE FRANCHISE DOCUMENTS, THE PROVISIONS ARE VOID AND CANNOT BE ENFORCED AGAINST YOU:</p>

<p>(a) A prohibition on the right of a franchisee to join an association of franchisees.</p>

<p>(b) A requirement that a franchisee assent to a release, assignment, novation, waiver, or estoppel which deprives a franchisee of rights and protections provided in this act. This shall not preclude a franchisee, after entering into a franchise agreement, from settling any and all claims.</p>

<p>(c) A provision that permits a franchisor to terminate a franchise prior to the expiration of its term except for good cause. Good cause shall include the failure of the franchisee to comply with any lawful provision of the franchise agreement and to cure such failure after being given written notice thereof and a reasonable opportunity, which in no event need be more than 30 days, to cure such failure.</p>

<p>(d) A provision that permits a franchisor to refuse to renew a franchise without fairly compensating the franchisee by repurchase or other means for the fair market value at the time of expiration of the franchisee&rsquo;s inventory, supplies, equipment, fixtures, and furnishings. Personalized materials which have no value to the franchisor and inventory, supplies, equipment, fixtures, and furnishings not reasonably required in the conduct of the franchise business are not subject to compensation. This subsection applies only if: (i) The term of the franchise is less than 5 years and (ii) the franchisee is prohibited by the franchise or other agreement from continuing to conduct substantially the same business under another trademark, service mark, trade name, logo type, advertising, or other commercial symbol in the same area subsequent to the expiration of the franchise or the franchisee does not receive at least 6 months advance notice of franchisor&rsquo;s intent not to renew the franchise.</p>

<p>(e) A provision that permits the franchisor to refuse to renew a franchise on terms generally available to other franchisees of the same class or type under similar circumstances. This section does not require a renewal provision.</p>

<p>(f) A provision requiring that arbitration or litigation be conducted outside this state. This shall not preclude the franchisee from entering into an agreement, at the time of arbitration, to conduct arbitration at a location outside this state.</p>

<p>(g) A provision which permits a franchisor to refuse to permit a transfer of ownership of a franchise, except for good cause. This subdivision does not prevent a franchisor from exercising a right of first refusal to purchase the franchise. Good cause shall include, but is not limited to: (i) The failure of the proposed transferee to meet the franchisor&rsquo;s then current reasonable qualifications or standards; (ii) The fact that the proposed transferee is a competitor of the franchisor or subfranchisor; (iii) The unwillingness of the proposed transferee to agree in writing to comply with all lawful obligations; (iv) The failure of the franchisee or proposed transferee to pay any sums owing to the franchisor or to cure any default in the franchise agreement existing at the time of the proposed transfer.</p>

<p>(h) A provision that requires the franchisee to resell to the franchisor items that are not uniquely identified with the franchisor. This subdivision does not prohibit a provision that grants to a franchisor a right of first refusal to purchase the assets of a franchise on the same terms and conditions as a bona fide third party willing and able to purchase those assets, nor does this subdivision prohibit a provision that grants the franchisor the right to acquire the assets of a franchise for the market or appraised value of such assets if the franchisee has breached the lawful provisions of the franchise agreement and has failed to cure the breach in the manner provided in subdivision (c).</p>

<p>(i) A provision which permits the franchisor to directly or indirectly convey, assign, or otherwise transfer its obligation to fulfill contractual obligations to the franchisee unless provision has been made for providing the required contractual services.</p>

<p>THE FACT THAT THERE IS A NOTICE OF THIS OFFERING ON FILE WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOES NOT CONSTITUTE APPROVAL, RECOMMENDATION, OR ENDORSEMENT BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.</p>

<p>11Total- We do not offer financing directly or indirectly for any part of the initial investment.</p>

<p>B. AREA DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT</p>

<p></p>

<p>Note 1- The low-end comprises of the initial franchise fee of $20,000 plus the $20,000 for the additional two outlets ($10,000 x 2). The high-end comprises of the initial franchise fee of $20,000 plus the $50,000 for the additional four outlets ($10,000 x 4).</p>

<p>Note 2-The low-end comprises of the low-end estimate from the Item 7.A table, less the $20,000 initial franchise fee, as it is included in the Area Development Fee ($42,500 - $20,000 = $22,500). The high-end comprises of the high-end estimate from the Item 7.A table, less the $20,000 initial franchise fee, as it is included in the Area Development Fee ($55,250 - $20,000 = $35,250).</p>

<p>The estimates in this Chart 7(B) assume that you will be entering into an Area Development Agreement for the right to open and operate three to five Franchised Businesses within a Development Area and the cost of opening the first Franchised Business.</p>

<p>The Area Development Fee ranges from $40,000 to $60,000 for three to five territories, as explained in Item 5 above. The Area Development Fee includes the Initial Franchise Fee on the first territory purchased under the Development Agreement and one-half the Initial Franchise Fee on additional territories. You pay the remaining one-half of the Initial Franchise Fee on additional territories at the time you enter into Franchise Agreements for such territories.</p>

<p>This figure represents the total estimated initial investment required to open your initial Franchised Business under the Franchise Agreement you must enter into with us at the same time as the execution of your Development Agreement.</p>

<p>Other than the Development Fee, this figure does not include the costs associated with opening a second and subsequent locations which will incur additional costs.</p>

You must open your franchised business and be operational within 60 days from executing the Franchise Agreement.

Up to 2 employees of your choosing may also attend at your option. The time frames provided in the chart are estimates of the time it will take to complete training. We do not charge for the initial training. You must pay for all travel costs and living expenses for yourself and any of your attendees. If you replace your helper s/he must attend our training program. You will be charged for additional training, as provided for in Item 6.

Additional training shall be at a cost of $250 per person per day if at our location, or $250 per person per day if the training is at your location (plus costs of travel, air fare and incidentals). (Sections 8.1, 8.3, and 8.4 of the Franchise Agreement).</p>

<p>ITEM 12. TERRITORY</p>

<p>The territory will be for a specific geographic region that we define and approve by radius, zip codes, natural, or political boundaries as set forth in the Franchise Agreement.</p>

<p>A territory will normally include an area of 200,000 households.</p>

<p>We would not normally have occasion to approve relocation of the franchised business because you will work from your home and a vehicle.</p>

<p>We would not normally grant to you approval to open an additional outlet within your territory, but may grant you additional franchise territories if we feel you have the time, energy, capital, and management structure to be able to successfully open and operate another territory.</p>

<p>We do not grant you options, rights of first refusal, or similar rights to acquire additional franchises.</p>

<p>You will receive an exclusive territory, meaning a geographic area within which we promise not to establish either a company-owned or franchised outlet selling the same or similar goods or services under the same or similar trademarks or service marks.</p>

<p>Continuation of your territorial rights does not depend on achieving a certain sales volume, market penetration, or other contingency, and we may not alter your franchise territory, even if there is a population increase in your territory.</p>

<p>We or an affiliate reserves the right to use other channels of distribution, such as the Internet, catalog sales, telemarketing, or other direct marketing sales, to solicit or accept orders within your territory using our principal trademarks, however, we would normally direct inquiries for services from within your territory to your outlet.</p>

<p>We or an affiliate also reserves the right to use other channels of distribution, such as the Internet, catalog sales, telemarketing, or other direct marketing sales, to make sales within your territory of products or services under trademarks different from the ones that you will use under the franchise agreement.</p>

<p>We are not obligated to pay compensation to you for soliciting or accepting orders from inside your territory.</p>

<p>You and other franchisees may not solicit (but may accept) orders from consumers outside of your territory, including through the use of other channels of distribution, such as the Internet, catalog sales, telemarketing, or other direct marketing, but you may engage in internet and social media marketing pursuant to our guidelines which such marketing may extend outside your territory. We also reserve the right to implement cross-territorial protocols and other guidelines applicable to such situations as group advertising buys by multiple franchisees which may extend into multiple territories, solicitation of orders of individuals who may reside in one territory, yet work in another, and other cross-territorial situations. You agree to abide by any such cross-territorial protocols.</p>

<p>Neither we nor an affiliate operates, franchises, or has plans to operate or franchise a business under a different trademark which such business sells or will sell goods or services similar to those you will offer, but we reserve the right to do so.</p>

<p>Area Developers:</p>

<p> Under the Area Development Agreement (the &ldquo;ADA&rdquo;), you will develop, open and operate multiple outlets within a defined Development Area (the &ldquo;Development Area&rdquo;). We determine the Development Area using the same criteria that we use in deciding the Territory for a Business.</p>

<p>ITEM 13. TRADEMARKS</p>

<p>The franchise agreement licenses to you the right to use the following principal trademarks (&ldquo;Marks&rdquo;) registered or applied for with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (&ldquo;USPTO&rdquo;):</p>

<p></p>

<p> We do not have a federal registration for our principal trademark. SERIAL/ REGISTRATION NO. 7036264: PRINCIPAL REGISTER: REGISTRATION DATE, APRIL 25, 2023.</p>

<p>There are no currently effective agreements that significantly limit our rights to use or license the use of our trademarks listed in this section.</p>

<p>There are no currently effective determinations of the USPTO, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, or any state trademark administrator or any court; or any pending infringement, opposition, or cancellation proceeding in which we unsuccessfully sought to prevent registration of a trademark in order to protect a trademark licensed by the franchisor. There is no pending material federal or state court litigation regarding our use or ownership rights in a trademark.</p>

<p>We know of no infringing or prior superior uses that could materially affect the use of the Marks.</p>

<p>You do not receive any rights to the Marks other than the right to use them in the operation of your Franchised Business. You must follow our rules when you use the Marks. You must use the Marks as the sole trade identification of the franchised business. You cannot use any Mark or portion of any Mark as part of any business entity name. You may not use any Mark in connection with the sale of any unauthorized services or products, or in any other manner that we do not authorize in writing. You must obtain a fictitious or assumed name registration if required by your state or local law. Any unauthorized use of the Marks by you is a breach of the Franchise Agreement and an infringement of our rights in the Marks. You must not contest the validity or ownership of the Marks, including any Marks that we license to you after you sign the Franchise Agreement. You must not assist any other person in contesting the validity or ownership of the Marks.</p>

<p>You must immediately notify us in writing when you learn about any claim of infringement, unfair competition, or similar claims about the Marks. You must not communicate with any person other than us and our counsel regarding any infringements, challenges or claims unless you are legally required to do so. However, you may communicate with your own counsel at your own expense. We are not required to take affirmative action when notified of these uses or claims. We have the sole right to control any administrative or judicial proceeding involving a trademark licensed by us. The Franchise Agreement does not require us to participate in your defense or indemnify you for expenses or damages if you are a party to an administrative or judicial proceeding involving a trademark licensed by us to you or if the proceeding is resolved unfavorable to you. You must take any actions that, in the opinion of our counsel, may be advisable to protect and maintain our interests in any proceeding or to otherwise protect and maintain our interests in the Marks.</p>

<p>If we require, you must modify or discontinue the use of any Mark and use other trademarks or service marks we designate. We do not have to reimburse you for modifying or discontinuing the use of a Mark or for substituting another trademark or service mark for a discontinued Mark. If we adopt and use new or modified Marks, you must add or replace equipment, supplies and fixtures, and you must make other modifications we designate as necessary to adapt your franchised business for the new or modified Marks. We do not reimburse you for any loss of goodwill associated with a modified or discontinued Mark.</p>

<p>You must notify us if you apply for your own trademark or service mark registrations. You must not register or seek to register as a trademark or service mark, either with the USPTO or any state or foreign country, any of the Marks or a trademark or service mark that is confusingly similar to any of our Marks.</p>

<p>Periodically, we may allow certain services or products that are not otherwise authorized for general use as a part of the System to be offered locally or regionally based on factors, including test marketing, your qualifications, and regional or local differences.</p>

Franchisor shall not charge for this service. Franchisor&rsquo;s advice or guidance to Franchisee relative to prices for products and services that, in Franchisor&rsquo;s judgment, constitutes good business practice is based upon the experience of Franchisor and its franchisees in operating Our Maids businesses and an analysis of costs and prices charged for competitive products and services.

<p> Except as otherwise provided herein, upon termination or expiration, this Agreement and all rights granted hereunder to Franchisee shall terminate and Franchisee shall:</p>

<p>immediately cease to operate the Franchised Business and shall not thereafter, directly or indirectly, represent to the public or hold itself out as a present or former franchisee of Franchisor;</p>

<p>cease to use the Trade Secrets or other Confidential Information, the System and the Marks, including, without limitation, all slogans, symbols, logos, advertising materials, stationery, forms, and any other items which display or are associated with the Marks;</p>

In the event of termination for any default of Franchisee, such sums shall include, but not be limited to, all damages, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees, with respect to litigation, arbitration, appellate, or bankruptcy proceedings, unpaid Royalty Fees, loss of future Royalty Fee payments incurred by Franchisor as a result of any early termination of this Agreement, and any other amounts due to Franchisor or any Affiliate;</p>

<p>pay to Franchisor all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees, incurred by Franchisor subsequent to the termination or expiration of the Franchise in obtaining injunctive or other relief for the enforcement of any provisions of this Agreement;</p>

<p>immediately return to Franchisor the Operations Manual, Trade Secrets, and all other Confidential Information, including records, files, instructions, brochures, agreements, disclosure statements, and any and all other materials provided by Franchisor to Franchisee relating to the operation of the Franchised Business (all of which are acknowledged to be Franchisor&rsquo;s property);</p>

<p>comply with all other applicable provisions of this Agreement.</p>

<p>17.2 Post-Termination Covenant Not to Compete</p>

<p> 17.2.1 Franchisee acknowledges that the restrictive covenants contained in this Section and in Section 17 are fair and reasonable.</p>

<p> 17.2.2 Except as otherwise approved in writing by Franchisor, neither Franchisee, nor any holder of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisee, nor any officer, director, executive, manager or member of the professional staff of Franchisee, shall, for a period of two (2) years after the expiration or termination of this Agreement, regardless of the cause of termination, either directly or indirectly: offer Competitive Business services located or operating (a) at or within a twenty-five (25) mile radius of the Franchised Business, or (b) within a twenty-five (25) mile radius of any other Our Maids Business in existence at the time of termination or expiration, or (c) any other business owned or operated by the Franchisor in existence at the time of termination or expansion;</p>

<p>solicit or otherwise attempt to induce or influence any customer or other business associate of Franchisor to terminate or modify his, her or its business relationship with Franchisor or to compete against Franchisor; or</p>

<p>In furtherance of this Section, Franchisor has the right to require certain individuals to execute standard form nondisclosure or non-competition agreements in a form the same as or similar to the Nondisclosure and Non-Competition Agreement attached as Schedule 2.</p>

<p>17.3 Unfair Competition</p>

<p> If Franchisee operates any other business, Franchisee shall not use any reproduction, counterfeit, copy or colorable imitation of the Marks, either in connection with such other business or the promotion thereof, that is likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception, or that is likely to dilute Franchisor&rsquo;s rights in the Marks. Franchisee shall not utilize any designation of origin, description or representation that falsely suggests or represents an association or connection with Franchisor. This Section is not intended as an approval of Franchisee&rsquo;s right to operate other businesses and in no way is it intended to contradict Sections 17, 17.1 or 17.2. Franchisee shall make such modifications or alterations to the Franchised Business (including changing telephone and facsimile numbers) immediately upon termination or expiration of this Agreement as may be necessary to prevent any association between Franchisor or the System and any business subsequently operated by Franchisee or others at the Franchised Business. Franchisee shall make such specific additional changes to the Franchised Business as Franchisor may reasonably request for that purpose including, without limitation, removal of all physical and structural features identifying or distinctive to the System. If Franchisee fails or refuses to comply with the requirements of this Section, Franchisor has the right to enter upon the Franchised Business for the purpose of making or causing to be made such changes as may be required, at the expense of Franchisee, which expense Franchisee shall pay upon demand.</p>

<p>17.4 Franchisor&rsquo;s Option to Purchase Certain Business Assets</p>

<p> Franchisor has the right (but not the obligation), for a period of thirty (30) days after termination or expiration of this Agreement, to purchase any or all assets of the Franchised Business including improvements, vehicles, service tools and equipment, supplies and other inventory or equipment. The purchase price shall be equal to the assets&rsquo; book value. If Franchisor elects to exercise this option to purchase, it has the right to set off all amounts due from Franchisee under this Agreement, if any, against the purchase price.</p>

<p>17.5 Survival of Certain Provisions</p>

<p> All obligations of Franchisor and Franchisee, which expressly or by their nature survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement, shall continue in full force and effect subsequent to and notwithstanding their expiration or termination and until satisfied or by their nature expire.</p>

<p>18. TRANSFERABILITY OF INTEREST</p>

<p>18.1 Transfer by Franchisor</p>

<p> This Agreement and all rights and duties hereunder are fully transferable in whole or in part by Franchisor and such rights will inure to the benefit of any person or entity to whom transferred; provided, however, that with respect to any assignment resulting in the subsequent performance by the assignee of the functions of Franchisor, the assignee shall assume the obligations of Franchisor hereunder and Franchisor shall thereafter have no liability for the performance of any obligations contained in this Agreement.</p>

<p>18.2 Transfer by Franchisee to a Third Party</p>

Accordingly, neither Franchisee nor any holder of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisee may sell, assign, convey, give away, pledge, mortgage, sublicense or otherwise transfer, whether by operation of law or otherwise, any interest in this Agreement, the Franchise granted hereby, the assets of the Franchised Business or any part or all of the ownership interest in Franchisee without the prior written approval of Franchisor. Any purported transfer without such approval shall be null and void and shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement. If Franchisee is in compliance with this Agreement, Franchisor&rsquo;s consent to such transfer shall be conditioned upon the satisfaction of the following requirements:</p>

<p>Franchisee has complied with the requirements in Section 19;</p>

<p>all obligations owed to Franchisor, and all other outstanding obligations relating to the Franchised Business, are fully paid and satisfied;</p>

<p>the prospective transferee has satisfied Franchisor that it meets Franchisor&rsquo;s management, business and financial standards, and otherwise possesses the character and capabilities, including business reputation and credit rating, as Franchisor may require to demonstrate ability to conduct the Franchised Business;</p>

<p>the transferee and, if Franchisor requires, all persons owning any interest in the transferee, have executed the then-current franchise agreement for new franchisees, which may be substantially different from this Agreement, including different Royalty Fee and other material provisions, and the franchise agreement then executed shall be for the term specified in such agreement;</p>

<p>the transferee has executed a general release, in a form the same as or similar to the General Release attached as Schedule 1, of any and all claims against Franchisor and its officers, directors, shareholders, managers, members, partners, owners, employees and agents (in their corporate and individual capacities), with respect to any representations regarding the Franchise or the business conducted pursuant thereto or any other matter that may have been made to the transferee by Franchisee;</p>

<p>Franchisee has provided Franchisor with a complete copy of all contracts and agreements and related documentation between Franchisee and the prospective transferee relating to the intended sale or transfer of the Franchise;</p>

<p>Franchisee, or the transferee, has paid to Franchisor, before the transaction is completed, a transfer fee in the amount of 25% of the then current initial franchise fee;</p>

<p>the transferee has obtained all necessary consents and approvals by third parties and all applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules, ordinances, and requirements applicable to the transfer have been complied with or satisfied;</p>

<p>Franchisee has, and if Franchisee is an entity, all of the holders of a legal and beneficial interest in Franchisee have executed and delivered to Franchisor a nondisclosure and non-competition agreement in a form satisfactory to Franchisor and in substance the same as the nondisclosure and non-competition covenants contained in Sections 7 and 17; and</p>

<p>the transferee agrees that it shall complete, to Franchisor&rsquo;s satisfaction, a training program in substance similar to the initial training described in Section 8.1 prior to assuming the management of the day-to-day operation of the Franchised Business.</p>

<p>18.3 Transfer to a Controlled Entity</p>

<p> 18.3.1 If Franchisee wishes to transfer this Agreement or any interest herein to a corporation, limited liability company or other legal entity which shall be entirely owned by Franchisee (&ldquo;Controlled Entity&rdquo;), which Controlled Entity is being formed for the financial planning, tax or other convenience of Franchisee, Franchisor&rsquo;s consent to such transfer shall be conditioned upon the satisfaction of the following requirements:</p>

<p>the Controlled Entity is newly organized and its charter or articles of formation provides that its activities are confined exclusively to the operation of the Franchised Business;</p>

<p>Franchisee or all holders of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisee own all of the equity and voting power of the outstanding stock or other capital interest in the Controlled Entity;</p>

<p>all obligations of Franchisee to Franchisor or any Affiliate are fully paid and satisfied; provided, however, that neither Franchisee nor the Controlled Entity shall be required to pay a transfer fee as required according to Section 18.2(h);</p>

<p>the Controlled Entity has entered into a written agreement with Franchisor expressly assuming the obligations of this Agreement and all other agreements relating to the operation of the Franchised Business. If the consent of any other party to any such other agreement is required, Franchisee has obtained such written consent and provided the same to Franchisor prior to consent by Franchisor;</p>

<p>all holders of a legal or beneficial interest in the Controlled Entity have entered into an agreement with Franchisor jointly and severally guaranteeing the full payment of the Controlled Entity&rsquo;s obligations to Franchisor and the performance by the Controlled Entity of all the obligations of this Agreement;</p>

<p>each stock certificate or other ownership interest certificate of the Controlled Entity has conspicuously endorsed upon the face thereof a statement in a form satisfactory to Franchisor that it is held subject to, and that further assignment or transfer thereof is subject to, all restrictions imposed upon transfers and assignments by this Agreement; and</p>

<p>copies of the Controlled Entity&rsquo;s articles of incorporation or organization, bylaws, operating agreement, federal tax identification number, and other governing regulations or documents, including resolutions of the board of directors authorizing entry into this Agreement, have been promptly furnished to Franchisor. Any amendment to any such documents shall also be furnished to Franchisor immediately upon adoption.</p>

<p> 18.3.2 The term of the transferred franchise shall be the unexpired term of this Agreement, including all renewal rights, subject to any and all conditions applicable to such renewal rights.</p>

<p> 18.3.3 Franchisor&rsquo;s consent to a transfer of any interest in this Agreement, or of any ownership interest in the Franchised Business, shall not constitute a waiver of any claims Franchisor may have against the transferor or the transferee, nor shall it be deemed a waiver of Franchisor&rsquo;s right to demand compliance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>

<p>18.4 Franchisor&rsquo;s Disclosure to Transferee</p>

<p> Franchisor has the right, without liability of any kind or nature whatsoever to Franchisee, to make available for inspection by any intended transferee of Franchisee all or any part of Franchisor&rsquo;s records relating to this Agreement, the Franchised Business or to the history of the relationship of the parties hereto. Franchisee hereby specifically consents to such disclosure by Franchisor and shall release and hold Franchisor harmless from and against any claim, loss or injury resulting from an inspection of Franchisor&rsquo;s records relating to the Franchised Business by an intended transferee identified by Franchisee.</p>

<p>18.5 For-Sale Advertising</p>

<p> Franchisee shall NOT, without prior written consent of Franchisor, place in, on or upon the area of the Franchised Business, or in any communication media, any form of advertising relating to the sale of the Franchised Business or the rights granted hereunder.</p>

<p>18.6 Transfer by Death or Incapacity</p>

<p> Upon the death or Incapacity of Franchisee (if Franchisee is an individual) or any holder of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisee (if Franchisee is a business entity), the appropriate representative of such person (whether administrator, personal representative or trustee) shall, within a reasonable time not exceeding one hundred eighty (180) days following such event, transfer such individual&rsquo;s interest in the Franchised Business or in Franchisee to a third party approved by Franchisor. Such transfers, including transfers by will or inheritance, shall be subject to the conditions for assignments and transfers contained in this Agreement. During such one hundred eighty (180) day period, the Franchised Business must remain at all times under the primary management of a Designated Manager who otherwise meets Franchisor&rsquo;s management qualifications.</p>

<p> Following such a death or Incapacity of such person as described in this Section 18.6, if necessary in Franchisor&rsquo;s discretion, Franchisor shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assume operation of the Franchised Business until the deceased or incapacitated owner&rsquo;s interest is transferred to a third party approved by Franchisor. Franchisor shall be given access to the Franchised Business, even if located within Franchisee&rsquo;s or its Designated Manager&rsquo;s principal residence, and shall not be held liable for trespass or any related tort. Franchisor may charge a management fee as stated in the Operations Manual from time to time, currently equal to $250 per person per day, and Franchisor shall be entitled to reimbursement of any expenses Franchisor incurs that are not paid out of the operating cash flow of the Franchised Business.</p>

<p>19. RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL</p>

<p>19.1 Submission of Offer</p>

<p> If Franchisee, or any of its owners, proposes to sell or otherwise transfer (including a transfer by death or Incapacity according to Section 18.6) the Franchised Business (or any of its assets outside of the normal course of business), any ownership interest in Franchisee or any ownership interest in the Franchise granted hereunder, Franchisee shall obtain and deliver a bona fide, executed written offer or proposal to purchase, along with all pertinent documents including any contract or due diligence materials, to Franchisor, except with regards to a sale or transfer to a family member. The offer must apply only to an approved sale of the assets or interests listed above and may not include any other property or rights of Franchisee or any of its owners.</p>

<p>19.2 Franchisor&rsquo;s Right to Purchase</p>

<p> Franchisor shall, for thirty (30) days from the date of delivery of all such documents, have the right, exercisable by written notice to Franchisee, to purchase the offered assets or interest for the price and on the same terms and conditions contained in such offer communicated to Franchisee. Franchisor has the right to substitute cash for the fair market value of any form of payment proposed in such offer. Franchisor&rsquo;s credit shall be deemed at least equal to the credit of any proposed buyer. After providing notice to Franchisee of Franchisor&rsquo;s intent to exercise this right of first refusal, Franchisor shall have up to sixty (60) days to close the purchase. Franchisor shall be entitled to receive from Franchisee all customary representations and warranties given by Franchisee as the seller of the assets or such ownership interest or, at Franchisor&rsquo;s election, such representations and warranties contained in the proposal.</p>

<p>19.3 Non-Exercise of Right of First Refusal</p>

<p> If Franchisor does not exercise its right of first refusal within thirty (30) days from the date of delivery of all such documents, the offer or proposal may be accepted by Franchisee or any of its owners, subject to Franchisor&rsquo;s prior written approval as required by Section 18.2. Should the sale fail to close within 120 days after the offer is delivered to Franchisor, Franchisor&rsquo;s right of first refusal shall renew and be implemented in accordance with this Section.</p>

<p>19.4 Sales or Transfers to Family Excepted</p>

<p> If Franchisee proposes to sell or otherwise transfer the Franchised Business (or any of its assets outside of the normal course of business), any ownership interest in Franchisee or any ownership interest in the Franchise granted hereunder to a member of Franchisee&rsquo;s (or its owners&rsquo;) family, then the terms and conditions of this Section shall be inapplicable. Nothing in this Section 19.4 shall be construed to relieve Franchisee from full compliance with the terms and conditions of Section 18.2 prior to a sale or transfer to family according to this Section.</p>

<p>20. BENEFICIAL OWNERS OF FRANCHISEE</p>

<p> Franchisee represents, and Franchisor enters into this Agreement in reliance upon such representation, that the individual(s) identified in Schedule 6 is/are the sole holder(s) of a legal or beneficial interest (in the stated percentages) of Franchisee.</p>

<p>21. RELATIONSHIP AND INDEMNIFICATION</p>

<p>21.1 Relationship</p>

<p> This Agreement is purely a contractual relationship between the parties and does not appoint or make Franchisee an agent, legal representative, joint-venturer, partner, employee, servant, or independent contractor of Franchisor for any purpose whatsoever. Franchisee may not represent or imply to third parties that Franchisee is an agent of Franchisor, and Franchisee is in no way authorized to make any contract, agreement, warranty, or representation on behalf of Franchisor, or to create any obligation, express or implied, on Franchisor&rsquo;s behalf. During the term of this Agreement, and any extension or renewal hereof, Franchisee shall hold itself out to the public only as a franchisee and an owner of the Franchised Business operating the Franchised Business according to a franchise from Franchisor. Franchisee shall take such affirmative action as may be necessary to do so including, without limitation, exhibiting a notice of that fact in a conspicuous place on all forms, stationery or other written materials, the content of which Franchisor has the right to specify. Under no circumstances shall Franchisor be liable for any act, omission, contract, debt, nor any other obligation of Franchisee. Franchisor shall in no way be responsible for any injuries to persons or property resulting from the operation of the Franchised Business by Franchisee. Any third-party contractors and vendors retained by Franchisee to convert or construct the premises are independent contractors of Franchisee alone.</p>

<p>21.2 Standard of Care</p>

<p> This Agreement does not establish a fiduciary relationship between the parties.</p>

<p>21.3 Indemnification</p>

<p> Franchisee shall hold harmless and indemnify Franchisor, any Affiliate, all holders of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisor and all officers, directors, executives, managers, members, partners, owners, employees, agents, successors and assigns (collectively &ldquo;Franchisor Indemnities&rdquo;) from and against all losses, damages, fines, costs, expenses or liability (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and all other costs of litigation) incurred in connection with any action, suit, demand, claim, investigation or proceeding, or any settlement thereof, which arises from or is based upon Franchisee&rsquo;s (a) ownership or operation of the Franchised Business; (b) violation, breach or asserted violation or breach of any federal, state or local law, regulation or rule; (c) breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or provision of this Agreement or any other agreement between Franchisee and Franchisor (or an Affiliate); (d) defamation of Franchisor or the System; (e) acts, errors or omissions committed or incurred in connection with the Franchised Business; or (f) infringement, violation or alleged infringement or violation of any Mark, patent or copyright or any misuse of the Trade Secrets or other Confidential Information. The obligations of this Section 21.3 shall expressly survive the termination of this Agreement.</p>

<p>21.4 Right to Retain Counsel</p>

<p> Franchisee shall give Franchisor immediate notice of any such action, suit, demand, claim, investigation, or proceeding that may give rise to a claim for indemnification by a Franchisor Indemnity. Franchisor has the right to retain counsel of its own choosing in connection with any such action, suit, demand, claim, investigation or proceeding. In order to protect persons, property, Franchisor&rsquo;s reputation or the goodwill of others, Franchisor has the right to, at any time without notice, take such remedial or corrective actions as it deems expedient with respect to any action, suit, demand, claim, investigation or proceeding if, in Franchisor&rsquo;s sole judgment, there are grounds to believe any of the acts or circumstances listed above have occurred. If Franchisor&rsquo;s exercise of its rights under this Section causes any of Franchisee&rsquo;s insurers to refuse to pay a third-party claim, all cause of action and legal remedies Franchisee might have against such insurer shall automatically be assigned to Franchisor without the need for any further action on either party&rsquo;s part. Under no circumstances shall Franchisor be required or obligated to seek coverage from third parties or otherwise mitigate losses in order to maintain a claim against Franchisee. The failure to pursue such remedy or mitigate such loss shall in no way reduce the amounts recoverable by Franchisor from Franchisee. Franchisee agrees to not be a party to class action suit against the Franchisor or any of its Affiliates under any circumstances.</p>

<p>22. GENERAL CONDITIONS AND PROVISIONS</p>

<p>22.1 No Waiver</p>

<p> No failure of Franchisor to exercise any power reserved to it hereunder, or to insist upon strict compliance by Franchisee with any obligation or condition hereunder, and no custom nor practice of the parties in variance with the terms hereof, shall constitute a waiver of Franchisor&rsquo;s right to demand exact compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Waiver by Franchisor of any particular default by Franchisee shall not be binding unless in writing and executed by Franchisor and shall not affect nor impair Franchisor&rsquo;s right with respect to any subsequent default of the same or of a different nature. Subsequent acceptance by Franchisor of any payment(s) due shall not be deemed to be a waiver by Franchisor of any preceding breach by Franchisee of any terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement.</p>

<p>22.2 Injunctive Relief</p>

<p> As any breach by Franchisee of any of the restrictions contained in Sections 6, 7, and 17 would result in irreparable injury to Franchisor, and as the damages arising out of any such breach would be difficult to ascertain, in addition to all other remedies provided by law or in equity, Franchisor shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief (whether a restraining order, a preliminary injunction or a permanent injunction) against any such breach, whether actual or contemplated, without the necessity of posting security or bond and Franchisee shall be responsible for Franchisor&rsquo;s reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees incurred in pursuing the same. Franchisor&rsquo;s right to seek injunctive relief will not affect the parties&rsquo; waiver of jury trial and covenant to arbitrate all disputes in accordance with Section 23.7. Franchisor&rsquo;s rights herein shall include pursuing injunctive relief through arbitration or in a state or federal court.</p>

<p>22.3 Notices</p>

<p> All notices required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed received: (a) at the time delivered by hand to the recipient party (or to an officer, director or partner of the recipient party); (b) on the next business day after transmission by facsimile or other reasonably reliable electronic communication system; (c) two (2) business days after being sent via guaranteed overnight delivery by a commercial courier service; or (d) five (5) business days after being sent by Registered Mail, return receipt requested. Either party may change its address by a written notice sent in accordance with this Section 22.3. All notices, payments and reports required by this Agreement shall be sent to Franchisor at the following address, or at such other address as Franchisor may provide:</p>

<p>22.4 Cost of Enforcement or Defense</p>

<p> If Franchisor is required to enforce this Agreement in a judicial or arbitration proceeding, if it is the prevailing party, it shall be entitled to reimbursement of its costs, including reasonable accounting and attorneys&rsquo; fees, in connection with such proceeding.</p>

<p>22.5 Unlimited Guaranty and Assumption of Obligations</p>

<p> All holders of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisee of five percent (5%) or greater shall be required to execute, as of the date of this Agreement, the Unlimited Guaranty and Assumption of Obligations attached as Schedule 3, through which such holders agree to assume and discharge all of Franchisee&rsquo;s obligations under this Agreement and to be personally liable hereunder for all of the same.</p>

<p>22.6 Approvals</p>

<p> Whenever this Agreement requires the prior approval or consent of Franchisor, Franchisee shall make a timely written request to Franchisor for such approval and, except as otherwise provided herein, any approval or consent granted shall be effective only if in writing. Franchisor makes no warranties or guarantees upon which Franchisee may rely, and assumes no liability or obligation to Franchisee or any third party to which it would not otherwise be subject, by providing any waiver, approval, advice, consent or services to Franchisee in connection with this Agreement, or by reason of any neglect, delay or denial of any request for approval.</p>

<p>22.7 Entire Agreement</p>

<p> This Agreement and all exhibits to this Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties and supersede any and all prior negotiations, understandings, representations, and agreements. Nothing in this or in any related agreement, however, is intended to disclaim the representations we made in the franchise disclosure document that we furnished to you. No amendment, change or variance from this Agreement shall be binding on either party unless executed in writing by both parties.</p>

<p>22.8 Severability and Modification</p>

<p> Except as noted below, each paragraph, part, term and provision of this Agreement shall be considered severable. If any paragraph, part, term or provision herein is ruled to be unenforceable, unreasonable or invalid, such ruling shall not impair the operation of or affect the remaining portions, paragraphs, parts, terms and provisions of this Agreement, and the latter shall continue to be given full force and effect and bind the parties; and such unenforceable, unreasonable or invalid paragraphs, parts, terms or provisions shall be deemed not part of this Agreement.</p>

<p> Notwithstanding the above, each of the covenants contained in Sections 7 and 17 shall be construed as independent of any other covenant or provision of this Agreement. If all or any portion of any such covenant is held to be unenforceable, unreasonable, or invalid, then it shall be amended to provide for limitations on disclosure of Trade Secrets or other Confidential Information or on competition to the maximum extent provided or permitted by law.</p>

<p>22.9 Construction</p>

<p> All captions herein are intended solely for the convenience of the parties, and none shall be deemed to affect the meaning or construction of any provision hereof.</p>

<p>22.10 Force Majeure</p>

<p> Whenever a period of time is provided in this Agreement for either party to perform any act, except pay monies, neither party shall be liable nor responsible for any delays due to strikes, lockouts, casualties, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental regulation or control or other causes beyond the reasonable control of the parties, and the time period for the performance of such act shall be extended for the amount of time of the delay. This clause shall not result in an extension of the term of this Agreement.</p>

<p>22.11 Timing</p>

<p> Time is of the essence. Except as in Section 22.10, failure to perform any act within the time required or permitted by this Agreement shall be a material breach.</p>

<p>22.12 Withholding Payments</p>

<p> Franchisee shall not, for any reason, withhold payment of any Royalty Fees or other amounts due to Franchisor or to an Affiliate. Franchisee shall not withhold or offset any amounts, damages or other monies allegedly due to Franchisee against any amounts due to Franchisor. No endorsement or statement on any payment for less than the full amount due to Franchisor will be construed as an acknowledgment of payment in full, or an accord and satisfaction, and Franchisor has the right to accept and cash any such payment without prejudice to Franchisor&rsquo;s right to recover the full amount due, or pursue any other remedy provided in this Agreement or by law. Franchisor has the right to apply any payments made by Franchisee against any of Franchisee&rsquo;s past due indebtedness as Franchisor deems appropriate. Franchisor shall set off sums Franchisor owes to Franchisee against any unpaid debts owed by Franchisee to Franchisor.</p>

<p>22.14 Third Party Beneficiaries</p>

<p> Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, nothing in this Agreement is intended, nor shall be deemed, to confer upon any person or legal entity other than Franchisor or Franchisee, and their respective successors and assigns as may be contemplated by this Agreement, any rights or remedies under this Agreement.</p>

<p>22.15 Multiple Originals</p>

<p> Both parties will execute multiple copies of this Agreement, and each executed copy will be deemed an original.</p>

<p>23. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</p>

<p>23.1 Choice of Law</p>

<p> Except as to claims governed by federal law, Delaware law governs all claims that in any way relate to or arise out of this Agreement or any of the dealings of the parties (&ldquo;Claims&rdquo;). However, no laws regulating the sale of franchises or governing the relationship between franchisor and franchisee shall apply unless the jurisdictional requirements of such laws are met independently of this paragraph.</p>

<p>23.2 Jurisdiction and Venue</p>

<p> You and we agree that venue and jurisdiction for any Claims, except those required to be submitted to arbitration, shall be proper solely in the state and federal court nearest to our corporate headquarters, presently located in Dover, Delaware. However, if you are an Illinois, Maryland, or Washington State resident or your franchise territory is located in Illinois, Maryland, or Washington State, you agree to bring any Claims, if at all, solely in arbitration before the American Arbitration Association in the city or county where our corporate headquarters are located.</p>

<p>23.3 Jury Waiver</p>

<p>23.5 Limitation of Damages</p>

<p> Franchisee and Franchisor each waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any right or claim for any punitive or exemplary damages against the other and agree that if there is a dispute with the other, each will be limited to the recovery of actual damages sustained by it including reasonable accounting and legal fees as provided in Section 22.4. Franchisee waives and disclaims any right to consequential damages in any action or claim against Franchisor concerning this Agreement or any related agreement. In any claim or action brought by Franchisee against Franchisor concerning this Agreement, Franchisee&rsquo;s contract damages shall not exceed and shall be limited to refund of Franchisee&rsquo;s Franchise Fee and Royalty Fees.</p>

<p>23.6 Limitation of Actions  You agree to bring any Claims against us, if at all, within one (1) year of the occurrence of the facts giving rise to such Claims, and that any action not brought within this period shall be barred as a claim, counterclaim, defense, or set-off.</p>

<p>23.7 Prior Notice of Claims</p>

<p> As a condition precedent to commencing an action for a Claim, you must notify us within thirty (30) days after the occurrence of the violation or breach, and failure to timely give such notice shall preclude any claim for damages.</p>

<p>23.8 Internal Dispute Resolution</p>

<p> You must first bring any Claim to our CEO, after providing notice as in Section 23.7 above. You must exhaust this internal dispute resolution procedure before you may bring your Claim before a third party.</p>

<p>23.9 Mediation and Arbitration</p>

<p> Before you may bring any Claim against us, you agree to try for a period of 60 days to mediate such claim before a mutually agreed to mediator in the city or county where our headquarters are located. If we cannot mutually agree on a mediator, you and we agree to use the mediation services of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), and split any AAA and mediator fees equally.</p>

<p> If mediation is unsuccessful and you decide to pursue a legal claim against us, you agree to bring such claim solely in binding arbitration conducted in the city or county where our headquarters is located, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. The proceedings will be held by a single arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding upon the parties. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having personal and subject matter jurisdiction.</p>

<p>23.10 Waiver of Bond</p>

<p>You agree that if we are forced to bring suit to enforce any provision of this Agreement, you agree to waive any requirement that we post bond to obtain a temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunction to enforce these duties.</p>

<p>23.11 Attorney Fees</p>

<p> If we are the substantially prevailing party as to any Claims, you agree to reimburse our costs and attorney fees incurred in pursuing or defending the Claims.</p>

<p>23.12 Third Party Beneficiaries</p>

<p>Our officers, directors, members, shareholders, agents, and employees are express third-party beneficiaries of the terms of the Dispute Resolution provisions contained herein.</p>

<p> Title:   __ SCHEDULE 2 TO THE FRANCHISE AGREEMENT NONDISCLOSURE AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT</p>

<p> This &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo; made as of the  _ day of     _, 20 _, is by and between      , (&ldquo;Franchisee,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us,&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) and        (&ldquo;Individual,&rdquo; &ldquo;you,&rdquo; or &ldquo;your&rdquo;).</p>

<p>W I T N E S S E T H:</p>

<p> WHEREAS, Franchisee is a party to that certain Franchise Agreement dated      , 20__ (&ldquo;Franchise Agreement&rdquo;) by and between Franchisee and the Franchisor, Our Maids Franchise, Inc. (&ldquo;Company&rdquo;); and</p>

<p> WHEREAS, Franchisee desires Individual to have access to and review certain Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information, which are more particularly described below; and</p>

<p> WHEREAS, Franchisee is required by the Franchise Agreement to have Individual execute this Agreement prior to providing Individual access to said Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information; and   WHEREAS, Individual understands the necessity of not disclosing any such information to any other party or using such information to compete against Company, Franchisee or any other franchisee of Company in any business (i) that offers or provides (or grants franchises or licenses to others to operate a business that offers or provides) products and services the same as or similar to those provided by Franchisee or (ii) in which Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information (as defined below) could be used to the disadvantage of Franchisee, or Company, any affiliate of Company or Company&rsquo;s other franchisees (hereinafter, &ldquo;Competitive Business&rdquo;); provided, however, that the term &ldquo;Competitive Business&rdquo; shall not apply to any business operated by Franchisee under a Franchise Agreement with Company.</p>

<p> NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and undertakings stated here, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereby mutually agree as follows:</p>

<p> 1. Trade Secrets and Confidential Information</p>

<p> Individual understands Franchisee possesses and will possess Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information that are important to its business.</p>

<p> a) For the purposes of this Agreement, a &ldquo;Trade Secret&rdquo; is information in any form (including, but not limited to, materials and techniques, technical or non-technical data, formulas, patterns, recipes compilations, programs, devices, methods, techniques, drawings, processes, financial data, financial plans, product plans, passwords, lists of actual or potential customers or suppliers) related to or used in the Our Maids Business that is not commonly known by or available to the public and that information: (i) derives economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (ii) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.</p>

<p> b) For the purposes of this Agreement &ldquo;Confidential Information&rdquo; means technical and non-technical information used in or related to Our Maids that is not commonly known by or available to the public, including, without limitation, Trade Secrets and information contained in the Operations Manual and training guides and materials. In addition, any other information identified as confidential when delivered by Franchisee shall be deemed Confidential Information. Confidential Information shall not include, however, any information that: (i) is now or subsequently becomes generally available to the public through no fault of Individual; (ii) Individual can demonstrate was rightfully in its possession, without obligation of nondisclosure, prior to disclosure according to this Agreement; (iii) is independently developed without the use of any Confidential Information; or (iv) is rightfully obtained from a third party who has the right, without obligation of nondisclosure, to transfer or disclose such information.</p>

<p> c) Any information expressly designated by Company or Franchisee as &ldquo;Trade Secrets&rdquo; or &ldquo;Confidential Information&rdquo; shall be deemed such for all purposes of this Agreement, but the absence of designation shall not relieve Individual of his or her obligations hereunder in respect of information otherwise constituting Trade Secrets or Confidential Information. Individual understands Franchisee&rsquo;s providing of access to the Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information creates a relationship of confidence and trust between Individual and Franchisee with respect to the Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information.</p>

<p> 2. Confidentiality/Non-Disclosure</p>

<p> a) Individual shall not communicate or divulge to (or use for the benefit of) any other person, firm, association, or corporation, with the sole exception of Franchisee, now or at any time in the future, any Trade Secrets or other Confidential Information. At all times from the date of this Agreement, Individual must take all steps reasonably necessary and/or requested by Franchisee to ensure that the Confidential Information and Trade Secrets are kept confidential according to the terms of this Agreement. Individual must comply with all applicable policies, procedures and practices that Franchisee has established and may establish from time to time with regard to the Confidential Information and Trade Secrets.</p>

<p> b) Individual&rsquo;s obligations under paragraph 2(a) of this Agreement shall continue in effect after termination of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee, regardless of the reason or reasons for termination, and whether such termination is voluntary or involuntary, and Franchisee is entitled to communicate Individual&rsquo;s obligations under this Agreement to any future customer or employer to the extent deemed necessary by Franchisee for protection of its rights hereunder and regardless of whether Individual or any of its affiliates or assigns becomes an investor, partner, joint venturer, broker, distributor or the like in an Our Maids Business.</p>

<p> 3. Non-Competition</p>

<p> a) During the term of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee and for a period of two (2) years after the expiration or termination of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee, regardless of the cause of expiration or termination, Individual shall not, directly or indirectly, divert or attempt to divert any business or customer of Franchisee or the Company to any Competitive Business, by direct or indirect inducement or otherwise, or do or perform, directly or indirectly, any other act injurious or prejudicial to the goodwill associated with the Company&rsquo;s service mark &ldquo;Our Maids&rdquo; and such other trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, designs, graphics, logos, emblems, insignia, fascia, slogans, drawings and other commercial symbols as the Company designates to be used in connection with Our Maids or the Company&rsquo;s uniform standards, methods, procedures and specifications for the establishment and operation of an Our Maids business.     b) During the term of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, regardless of the cause of termination, Individual shall not, directly or indirectly, offer Competitive Business services anywhere within a TWENTY FIVE (25) mile radius of any Our Maids location without the express written consent of Franchisee and the Company.</p>

<p> c) During the term of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, regardless of the cause of termination, Individual shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit or otherwise attempt to induce or influence any business associate of Franchisee, Company or any other Our Maids Business to compete against, or terminate or modify his, her or its business relationship with, Franchisee, Company or any other Our Maids Business.</p>

<p> 4. Reasonableness of Restrictions</p>

<p> Individual acknowledges that each of the terms stated here, including the restrictive covenants, is fair and reasonable and is reasonably required for the protection of Franchisee, Company, and Company&rsquo;s Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information, the Company&rsquo;s business system, network of franchises and trade and service marks, and Individual waives any right to challenge these restrictions as being overly broad, unreasonable or otherwise unenforceable. If, however, a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any such restriction is unreasonable or unenforceable, then Individual shall submit to the reduction of any such activity, time period or geographic restriction necessary to enable the court to enforce such restrictions to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. It is the desire and intent of the parties that the provisions of this Agreement shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies applied in any jurisdiction where enforcement is sought.</p>

<p> 5. Relief for Breaches of Confidentiality, Non-Solicitation, and Non-Competition</p>

<p> Individual further acknowledges that an actual or threatened violation of the covenants contained in this Agreement will cause Franchisee and Company immediate and irreparable harm, damage and injury that cannot be fully compensated for by an award of damages or other remedies at law. Accordingly, Franchisee and/or Company shall be entitled, as a matter of right, to an injunction from any court of competent jurisdiction restraining any further violation by Individual of this Agreement without any requirement to show any actual damage or to post any bond or other security. Such right to an injunction shall be cumulative and in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights and remedies that Franchisee and Company may have at law or in equity.</p>

<p> 6. Dispute Resolution</p>

<p> a) Choice of Law. Except as to claims governed by federal law, the local law where the Franchised Business is located governs all claims that in any way relate to or arise out of this Agreement or any of the dealings of the parties (&ldquo;Claims&rdquo;). However, no laws regulating the sale of franchises or governing the relationship between franchisor and franchisee shall apply unless the jurisdictional requirements of such laws are met independently of this paragraph.</p>

<p> b) Jurisdiction and Venue. You and we agree that venue and jurisdiction for any Claims, except those required to be submitted to arbitration, shall be proper solely in the state and federal court nearest to our corporate headquarters.</p>

<p> c) Jury Waiver. In any trial between any of the parties as to any Claims, you and we agree to waive our rights to a jury trial and instead have such action tried by a judge.</p>

<p> d) Class Action Waiver. You agree to bring any Claims, if at all, individually and you shall not join such claim with claims of any other person or entity or bring, join or participate in a class action against us.  e) Punitive Damages Waiver. As to any Claims, you and we agree to waive our rights, if any, to seek or recover punitive damages.</p>

<p> f) Limitation of Actions. You agree to bring any Claims against us, if at all, within one (1) year of the occurrence of the facts giving rise to such Claims, and that any action not brought within this period shall be barred as a claim, counterclaim, defense, or set-off.</p>

<p>g) Prior Notice of Claims. As a condition precedent to commencing an action for a Claim, you must notify us within thirty (30) days after the occurrence of the violation or breach, and failure to timely give such notice shall preclude any claim for damages.</p>

<p>h) Internal Dispute Resolution. You must first bring any Claim to our CEO, after providing notice as in Section 6(g) above. You must exhaust this internal dispute resolution procedure before you may bring your Claim before a third party.</p>

<p> i) Mediation and Arbitration. Before you may bring any Claim against us court, you agree to try for a period of 60 days to mediate such claim before a mutually agreed to mediator in the city or county where our headquarters are located. If we cannot mutually agree on a mediator, you and we agree to use the mediation services of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), and split any AAA and mediator fees equally.</p>

<p> If mediation is unsuccessful and you decide to pursue a legal claim against us, you agree to bring such claim solely in binding arbitration conducted in the city or county of our headquarters in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. The proceedings will be held by a single arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding upon the parties. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having personal and subject matter jurisdiction.</p>

<p>j) Waiver of Bond. You agree that if we are forced to bring suit to enforce any provision of this Agreement, you agree to waive any requirement that we post bond to obtain a temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunction to enforce these duties.</p>

<p>k) Attorney Fees. If we are the substantially prevailing party as to any Claims, you agree to reimburse our costs and attorney fees incurred in pursuing or defending the Claims.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>1. Use. Tenant is a franchisee of Franchisor. The Leased Premises shall be used only for the operation of an Our Maids business (or any name authorized by Franchisor).</p>

<p>2. Notice of Default and Opportunity To Cure. Landlord shall provide Franchisor with copies of any written notice of default (&ldquo;Default&rdquo;) given to Tenant under the Lease, and Landlord grants to Franchisor the option (but not the obligation) to cure any Default under the Lease (should Tenant fail to do so) within 10 days after the expiration of the period in which Tenant may cure the Default.</p>

<p>3. Termination of Lease. Landlord shall copy Franchisor on any notice of termination of the Lease. If Landlord terminates the Lease for Tenant&rsquo;s Default, Franchisor shall have the option to enter into a new Lease with Landlord on the same terms and conditions as the terminated Lease, subject to Landlord&rsquo;s approval in its reasonable discretion. To exercise this option, Franchisor must notify Landlord within 10 days after Franchisor receives notice of the termination of the Lease.</p>

<p>4. Termination of Franchise Agreement. If the Franchise Agreement between Franchisor and Tenant is terminated during the term of the Lease, then upon the written request of Franchisor, Landlord and Tenant consent to allow Franchisor to assume any existing term of the Lease (the &ldquo;Assumption&rdquo;), provided that any and all defaults have been cured and all payments due under the Lease are current, and to enter into a written agreement providing for such Assumption. In the event of an Assumption, Landlord will deliver possession of the Leased Premises to Franchisor free and clear of any rights of the Tenant or any third party. Landlord further consents to give Franchisor the right, following the Assumption, to assign its interest in the Lease or to sublet the Leased Premises to another franchisee of Franchisor with reasonable consent from the Landlord.</p>

<p>5. Assignment and Subletting. Notwithstanding any provision of the Lease to the contrary, Tenant shall have the right to assign or sublet the Lease to Franchisor, provided that no such assignment or sublease shall relieve Tenant or any guarantor of liability under the Lease. If Franchisor becomes the lessee of the Leased Premises, then Franchisor shall have the right to assign or sublease its lease to a franchisee of Franchisor&rsquo;s brand, subject to Landlord&rsquo;s approval in its reasonable discretion.</p>

<p>6. Authorization. Tenant authorizes Landlord and Franchisor to communicate directly with each other about Tenant and Tenant&rsquo;s business.</p>

<p>7. Right to Enter. Upon the expiration or termination of the Franchise Agreement or the Lease, or the termination of Tenant&rsquo;s right of possession of the Leased Premises, Franchisor or its designee may, after giving reasonable prior notice to Landlord, enter the Leased Premises within 10 days of such expiration or termination, to take any such actions as may be consistent with its rights under this Lease Addendum or to remove signs and other material bearing Franchisor&rsquo;s brand name, trademarks, and commercial symbols.</p>

<p>8. No Liability. By executing this Addendum, Franchisor does not assume any liability with respect to the Leased Premises or any obligation as Tenant under the Lease.</p>

<p> 1. Any claims arising under the Maryland Franchise Registration and Disclosure Law must be brought within 3 years after the grant of the franchise.</p>

<p> 2. A general release required as a condition of renewal, sale, and/or assignment/transfer shall not apply to any liability under the Maryland Franchise Registration and Disclosure Law.</p>

<p>If any of the terms of the Franchise Agreement are inconsistent with the terms below, the terms below control.</p>

<p>Minn. Stat. &sect;80C.21 and Minn. Rule 2860.4400(J) prohibit the franchisor from requiring litigation to be conducted outside Minnesota, requiring waiver of a jury trial, or requiring the franchisee to consent to liquidated damages, termination penalties or judgment notes. In addition, nothing in the Franchise Disclosure Document or agreements can abrogate or reduce (1) any of the franchisee&rsquo;s rights as provided for in Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 80C, or (2) franchisee&rsquo;s rights to any procedure, forum, or remedies provided for by the laws of the jurisdiction.</p>

<p>With respect to franchises governed by Minnesota law, the franchisor will comply with Minn. Stat. Sec. 80C.14 Subds. 3, 4, and 5 which require (except in certain specified cases), that a franchisee be given 90 days&rsquo; notice of termination (with 60 days to cure) and 180 days&rsquo; notice for non-renewal of the franchise agreement and that consent to the transfer of the franchise will not be unreasonably withheld.</p>

<p>The franchisor will protect the franchisee&rsquo;s rights to use the trademarks, service marks, trade names, logotypes or other commercial symbols or indemnify the franchisee from any loss, costs or expenses arising out of any claim, suit or demand regarding the use of the name.</p>

<p>Minnesota considers it unfair to not protect the franchisee&rsquo;s right to use the trademarks. Refer to Minnesota Statutes 80C.12, Subd. 1(g).</p>

<p>Minnesota Rules 2860.4400(D) prohibits a franchisor from requiring a franchisee to assent to a general release.</p>

<p>The franchisee cannot consent to the franchisor obtaining injunctive relief. The franchisor may seek injunctive relief. See Minn. Rules 2860.4400J.</p>

<p>Also, a court will determine if a bond is required.</p>

<p>Any Limitations of Claims section must comply with Minnesota Statutes, Section 80C.17, Subd. 5.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON ADDENDUM TO THE FRANCHISE AGREEMENT</p>

<p>If any of the terms of the Franchise Agreement are inconsistent with the terms below, the terms below control.</p>

<p>In the event of a conflict of laws, the provisions of the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, Chapter 19.100 RCW will prevail.</p>

<p>RCW 19.100.180 may supersede the franchise agreement in your relationship with the franchisor including the areas of termination and renewal of your franchise. There may also be court decisions which may supersede the franchise agreement in your relationship with the franchisor including the areas of termination and renewal of your franchise.</p>

<p>In any arbitration or mediation involving a franchise purchased in Washington, the arbitration or mediation site will be either in the state of Washington, or in a place mutually agreed upon at the time of the arbitration or mediation, or as determined by the arbitrator or mediator at the time of arbitration or mediation. In addition, if litigation is not precluded by the franchise agreement, a franchisee may bring an action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with the sale of franchises, or a violation of the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, in Washington.</p>

<p>A release or waiver of rights executed by a franchisee may not include rights under the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act or any rule or order thereunder except when executed pursuant to a negotiated settlement after the agreement is in effect and where the parties are represented by independent counsel. Provisions such as those which unreasonably restrict or limit the statute of limitations period for claims under the Act, or rights or remedies under the Act such as a right to a jury trial, may not be enforceable.</p>

<p>Transfer fees are collectable to the extent that they reflect the franchisor&rsquo;s reasonable estimated or actual costs in effecting a transfer.</p>

<p>Pursuant to RCW 49.62.020, a noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable against an employee, including an employee of a franchisee, unless the employee&rsquo;s earnings from the party seeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed $100,000 per year (an amount that will be adjusted annually for inflation). In addition, a noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable against an independent contractor of a franchisee under RCW 49.62.030 unless the independent contractor&rsquo;s earnings from the party seeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed $250,000 per year (an amount that will be adjusted annually for inflation). As a result, any provisions contained in the franchise agreement or elsewhere that conflict with these limitations are void and unenforceable in Washington.</p>

<p>RCW 49.62.060 prohibits a franchisor from restricting, restraining, or prohibiting a franchisee from (i) soliciting or hiring any employee of a franchisee of the same franchisor or (ii) soliciting or hiring any employee of the franchisor. As a result, any such provisions contained in the franchise agreement or elsewhere are void and unenforceable in Washington.</p>

<p>Section 17.2.2(a) is modified to also provide that the post-term non-compete will only apply to a 25 mile radius of your Franchised Business.</p>

<p>Section 21.3 is modified to also provide that the indemnification does not extend to liabilities resulting from the gross negligence of willful misconduct of any Franchisor indemnitee.</p>

<p>The Franchise Agreement is amended to also include the following language:</p>

<p>With respect to franchises governed by Wisconsin law, the Wisconsin Fair Dealership Law applies to most, if not all, franchise agreements and prohibits the termination, cancellation, non-renewal or the substantial change of the competitive circumstances of a dealership agreement without good cause. That Law further provides that 90 days&rsquo; prior written notice of a proposed termination, etc. must be given to the dealer. The dealer has 60 days to cure the deficiency and if the deficiency is cured, the notice is void.</p>

<p>As to franchises governed by the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, if any of the terms of the Disclosure Document are inconsistent with the terms below, the terms below control.</p>

<p>In the event of a conflict of laws, the provisions of the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, Chapter 19.100 RCW will prevail.</p>

<p>RCW 19.100.180 may supersede the franchise agreement in your relationship with the franchisor including the areas of termination and renewal of your franchise. There may also be court decisions which may supersede the franchise agreement in your relationship with the franchisor including the areas of termination and renewal of your franchise.</p>

<p>In any arbitration or mediation involving a franchise purchased in Washington, the arbitration or mediation site will be either in the state of Washington, or in a place mutually agreed upon at the time of the arbitration or mediation, or as determined by the arbitrator or mediator at the time of arbitration or mediation. In addition, if litigation is not precluded by the franchise agreement, a franchisee may bring an action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with the sale of franchises, or a violation of the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, in Washington.</p>

<p>A release or waiver of rights executed by a franchisee may not include rights under the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act or any rule or order thereunder except when executed pursuant to a negotiated settlement after the agreement is in effect and where the parties are represented by independent counsel. Provisions such as those which unreasonably restrict or limit the statute of limitations period for claims under the Act, or rights or remedies under the Act such as a right to a jury trial, may not be enforceable.</p>

<p>Transfer fees are collectable to the extent that they reflect the franchisor&rsquo;s reasonable estimated or actual costs in effecting a transfer.</p>

<p>Pursuant to RCW 49.62.020, a noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable against an employee, including an employee of a franchisee, unless the employee&rsquo;s earnings from the party seeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed $100,000 per year (an amount that will be adjusted annually for inflation). In addition, a noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable against an independent contractor of a franchisee under RCW 49.62.030 unless the independent contractor&rsquo;s earnings from the party seeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed $250,000 per year (an amount that will be adjusted annually for inflation). As a result, any provisions contained in the franchise agreement or elsewhere that conflict with these limitations are void and unenforceable in Washington.</p>

<p>RCW 49.62.060 prohibits a franchisor from restricting, restraining, or prohibiting a franchisee from (i) soliciting or hiring any employee of a franchisee of the same franchisor or (ii) soliciting or hiring any employee of the franchisor. As a result, any such provisions contained in the franchise agreement or elsewhere are void and unenforceable in Washington.</p>

<p>A release or waiver of rights signed by the franchisee shall not include rights under the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act except when executed according to a negotiated settlement after the agreement is in effect and where the parties are represented by independent counsel. Provisions such as those that unreasonably restrict or limit the statute of limitations period for claims under the Act, rights or remedies under the Act such as a right to a jury trial may not be enforceable.</p>

<p> MINNESOTA ADDENDUM TO THE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT</p>

<p>As to franchises governed by the Minnesota franchise laws, if any of the terms of the Disclosure Document are inconsistent with the terms below, the terms below control.</p>

<p>Minn. Stat. &sect;80C.21 and Minn. Rule 2860.4400(J) prohibit the franchisor from requiring litigation to be conducted outside Minnesota, requiring waiver of a jury trial, or requiring the franchisee to consent to liquidated damages, termination penalties or judgment notes. In addition, nothing in the Franchise Disclosure Document or agreements can abrogate or reduce (1) any of the franchisee&rsquo;s rights as provided for in Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 80C, or (2) franchisee&rsquo;s rights to any procedure, forum, or remedies provided for by the laws of the jurisdiction.</p>

<p>With respect to franchises governed by Minnesota law, the franchisor will comply with Minn. Stat. Sec. 80C.14 Subds. 3, 4, and 5 which require (except in certain specified cases), that a franchisee be given 90 days&rsquo; notice of termination (with 60 days to cure) and 180 days&rsquo; notice for non-renewal of the franchise agreement and that consent to the transfer of the franchise will not be unreasonably withheld.</p>

<p>Minnesota Rules 2860.4400(D) prohibits a franchisor from requiring a franchisee to assent to a general release.</p>

<p>The franchisee cannot consent to the franchisor obtaining injunctive relief. The franchisor may seek injunctive relief. See Minn. Rules 2860.4400J.</p>

<p>RCW 19.100.180 may supersede the franchise agreement in your relationship with the franchisor including the areas of termination and renewal of your franchise. There may also be court decisions which may supersede the franchise agreement in your relationship with the franchisor including the areas of termination and renewal of your franchise.</p>

<p>In any arbitration or mediation involving a franchise purchased in Washington, the arbitration or mediation site will be either in the state of Washington, or in a place mutually agreed upon at the time of the arbitration or mediation, or as determined by the arbitrator or mediator at the time of arbitration or mediation.

<p>A release or waiver of rights executed by a franchisee may not include rights under the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act or any rule or order thereunder except when executed pursuant to a negotiated settlement after the agreement is in effect and where the parties are represented by independent counsel. Provisions such as those which unreasonably restrict or limit the statute of limitations period for claims under the Act, or rights or remedies under the Act such as a right to a jury trial, may not be enforceable.</p>

That Law further provides that 90 days&rsquo; prior written notice of a proposed termination, etc. must be given to the dealer.

<p>Issuance Date: March 20, 2023</p>

<p>How to Use This Franchise Disclosure Document</p>

<p>Here are some questions you may be asking about buying a franchise and tips on how to find more information:</p>

<p>What You Need To Know About Franchising Generally</p>

<p>Continuing responsibility to pay fees. You may have to pay royalties and other fees even if you are losing money.    Business model can change. The franchise agreement may allow the franchisor to change its manuals and business model without your consent. These changes may require you to make additional investments in your franchise business or may harm your franchise business.    Supplier restrictions. You may have to buy or lease items from the franchisor or a limited group of suppliers the franchisor designates. These items may be more expensive than similar items you could buy on your own.    Operating restrictions. The franchise agreement may prohibit you from operating a similar business during the term of the franchise. There are usually other restrictions. Some examples may include controlling your location, your access to customers, what you sell, how you market, and your hours of operation.    Competition from franchisor. Even if the franchise agreement grants you a territory, the franchisor may have the right to compete with you in your territory.    Renewal. Your franchise agreement may not permit you to renew. Even if it does, you may have to sign a new agreement with different terms and conditions in order to continue to operate your franchise business.    When your franchise ends. The franchise agreement may prohibit you from operating a similar business after your franchise ends even if you still have obligations to your landlord or other creditors.    Some States Require Registration   Your state may have a franchise law, or other law, that requires franchisors to register before offering or selling franchises in the state. Registration does not mean that the state recommends the franchise or has verified the information in this document. To find out if your state has a registration requirement, or to contact your state, use the agency information in Exhibit A.    Your state also may have laws that require special disclosures or amendments be made to your franchise agreement. If so, you should check the State Specific Addenda. See the Table of Contents for the location of the State Specific Addenda.  </p>

<p>Special Risks to Consider About This Franchise   Certain states require that the following risk(s) be highlighted:     1. Out-of-State Dispute Resolution. The franchise agreement requires you to resolve disputes with the franchisor by mediation, arbitration and/or litigation only in Delaware. Out-of-state mediation, arbitration, or litigation may force you to accept a less favorable settlement for disputes. It may also cost more to mediate, arbitrate, or litigate with the franchisor in Delaware than in your own state.</p>

<p> 2. Short Operating History. The franchisor is at an early stage of development and has a limited operating history. This franchise is likely to be a riskier investment than a franchise in a system with a longer operating history.</p>

<p> 3. Financial Condition. The Franchisor&rsquo;s financial condition as reflected in its financial statements (see Item 21) calls into question the Franchisor&rsquo;s financial ability to provide services and support to you.</p>

<p>Certain states may require other risks to be highlighted. Check the &ldquo;State Specific Addenda&rdquo; (if any) to see whether your state requires other risks to be highlighted.</p>

<p>MICHIGAN ADDENDUM TO THE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT</p>

<p>THE STATE OF MICHIGAN PROHIBITS CERTAIN UNFAIR PROVISIONS THAT ARE SOMETIMES IN FRANCHISE DOCUMENTS. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS ARE IN THESE FRANCHISE DOCUMENTS, THE PROVISIONS ARE VOID AND CANNOT BE ENFORCED AGAINST YOU:</p>

<p>(a) A prohibition on the right of a franchisee to join an association of franchisees.</p>

<p>(b) A requirement that a franchisee assent to a release, assignment, novation, waiver, or estoppel which deprives a franchisee of rights and protections provided in this act. This shall not preclude a franchisee, after entering into a franchise agreement, from settling any and all claims.</p>

<p>(c) A provision that permits a franchisor to terminate a franchise prior to the expiration of its term except for good cause. Good cause shall include the failure of the franchisee to comply with any lawful provision of the franchise agreement and to cure such failure after being given written notice thereof and a reasonable opportunity, which in no event need be more than 30 days, to cure such failure.</p>

<p>(d) A provision that permits a franchisor to refuse to renew a franchise without fairly compensating the franchisee by repurchase or other means for the fair market value at the time of expiration of the franchisee&rsquo;s inventory, supplies, equipment, fixtures, and furnishings. Personalized materials which have no value to the franchisor and inventory, supplies, equipment, fixtures, and furnishings not reasonably required in the conduct of the franchise business are not subject to compensation. This subsection applies only if: (i) The term of the franchise is less than 5 years and (ii) the franchisee is prohibited by the franchise or other agreement from continuing to conduct substantially the same business under another trademark, service mark, trade name, logo type, advertising, or other commercial symbol in the same area subsequent to the expiration of the franchise or the franchisee does not receive at least 6 months advance notice of franchisor&rsquo;s intent not to renew the franchise.</p>

<p>(e) A provision that permits the franchisor to refuse to renew a franchise on terms generally available to other franchisees of the same class or type under similar circumstances. This section does not require a renewal provision.</p>

<p>(f) A provision requiring that arbitration or litigation be conducted outside this state. This shall not preclude the franchisee from entering into an agreement, at the time of arbitration, to conduct arbitration at a location outside this state.</p>

<p>(g) A provision which permits a franchisor to refuse to permit a transfer of ownership of a franchise, except for good cause. This subdivision does not prevent a franchisor from exercising a right of first refusal to purchase the franchise. Good cause shall include, but is not limited to: (i) The failure of the proposed transferee to meet the franchisor&rsquo;s then current reasonable qualifications or standards; (ii) The fact that the proposed transferee is a competitor of the franchisor or subfranchisor; (iii) The unwillingness of the proposed transferee to agree in writing to comply with all lawful obligations; (iv) The failure of the franchisee or proposed transferee to pay any sums owing to the franchisor or to cure any default in the franchise agreement existing at the time of the proposed transfer.</p>

<p>(h) A provision that requires the franchisee to resell to the franchisor items that are not uniquely identified with the franchisor. This subdivision does not prohibit a provision that grants to a franchisor a right of first refusal to purchase the assets of a franchise on the same terms and conditions as a bona fide third party willing and able to purchase those assets, nor does this subdivision prohibit a provision that grants the franchisor the right to acquire the assets of a franchise for the market or appraised value of such assets if the franchisee has breached the lawful provisions of the franchise agreement and has failed to cure the breach in the manner provided in subdivision (c).</p>

<p>(i) A provision which permits the franchisor to directly or indirectly convey, assign, or otherwise transfer its obligation to fulfill contractual obligations to the franchisee unless provision has been made for providing the required contractual services.</p>

<p>THE FACT THAT THERE IS A NOTICE OF THIS OFFERING ON FILE WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOES NOT CONSTITUTE APPROVAL, RECOMMENDATION, OR ENDORSEMENT BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.</p>

<p>B. AREA DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT</p>

<p></p>

<p>Note 2-The low-end comprises of the low-end estimate from the Item 7.A table, less the $20,000 initial franchise fee, as it is included in the Area Development Fee ($42,500 - $20,000 = $22,500). The high-end comprises of the high-end estimate from the Item 7.A table, less the $20,000 initial franchise fee, as it is included in the Area Development Fee ($55,250 - $20,000 = $35,250).</p>

<p>The estimates in this Chart 7(B) assume that you will be entering into an Area Development Agreement for the right to open and operate three to five Franchised Businesses within a Development Area and the cost of opening the first Franchised Business.</p>

<p>The Area Development Fee ranges from $40,000 to $60,000 for three to five territories, as explained in Item 5 above. The Area Development Fee includes the Initial Franchise Fee on the first territory purchased under the Development Agreement and one-half the Initial Franchise Fee on additional territories.

Factors that may affect your beginning operations include the ability to secure permits, obtain equipment, and hire and train employees. You must open your franchised business and be operational within 60 days from executing the Franchise Agreement.

Up to 2 employees of your choosing may also attend at your option. The time frames provided in the chart are estimates of the time it will take to complete training.

<p>ITEM 12. TERRITORY</p>

<p>The territory will be for a specific geographic region that we define and approve by radius, zip codes, natural, or political boundaries as set forth in the Franchise Agreement.</p>

<p>A territory will normally include an area of 200,000 households.</p>

<p>We would not normally have occasion to approve relocation of the franchised business because you will work from your home and a vehicle.</p>

<p>We would not normally grant to you approval to open an additional outlet within your territory, but may grant you additional franchise territories if we feel you have the time, energy, capital, and management structure to be able to successfully open and operate another territory.</p>

<p>We do not grant you options, rights of first refusal, or similar rights to acquire additional franchises.</p>

<p>You will receive an exclusive territory, meaning a geographic area within which we promise not to establish either a company-owned or franchised outlet selling the same or similar goods or services under the same or similar trademarks or service marks.</p>

<p>Continuation of your territorial rights does not depend on achieving a certain sales volume, market penetration, or other contingency, and we may not alter your franchise territory, even if there is a population increase in your territory.</p>

<p>We or an affiliate reserves the right to use other channels of distribution, such as the Internet, catalog sales, telemarketing, or other direct marketing sales, to solicit or accept orders within your territory using our principal trademarks, however, we would normally direct inquiries for services from within your territory to your outlet.</p>

<p>We or an affiliate also reserves the right to use other channels of distribution, such as the Internet, catalog sales, telemarketing, or other direct marketing sales, to make sales within your territory of products or services under trademarks different from the ones that you will use under the franchise agreement.</p>

<p>We are not obligated to pay compensation to you for soliciting or accepting orders from inside your territory.</p>

<p>You and other franchisees may not solicit (but may accept) orders from consumers outside of your territory, including through the use of other channels of distribution, such as the Internet, catalog sales, telemarketing, or other direct marketing, but you may engage in internet and social media marketing pursuant to our guidelines which such marketing may extend outside your territory. We also reserve the right to implement cross-territorial protocols and other guidelines applicable to such situations as group advertising buys by multiple franchisees which may extend into multiple territories, solicitation of orders of individuals who may reside in one territory, yet work in another, and other cross-territorial situations. You agree to abide by any such cross-territorial protocols.</p>

<p>Neither we nor an affiliate operates, franchises, or has plans to operate or franchise a business under a different trademark which such business sells or will sell goods or services similar to those you will offer, but we reserve the right to do so.</p>

<p>Area Developers:</p>

<p> Under the Area Development Agreement (the &ldquo;ADA&rdquo;), you will develop, open and operate multiple outlets within a defined Development Area (the &ldquo;Development Area&rdquo;). We determine the Development Area using the same criteria that we use in deciding the Territory for a Business.</p>

<p>ITEM 13. TRADEMARKS</p>

<p>The franchise agreement licenses to you the right to use the following principal trademarks (&ldquo;Marks&rdquo;) registered or applied for with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (&ldquo;USPTO&rdquo;):</p>

<p></p>

<p> We do not have a federal registration for our principal trademark. SERIAL/ REGISTRATION NO. 7036264: PRINCIPAL REGISTER: REGISTRATION DATE, APRIL 25, 2023.</p>

<p>There are no currently effective agreements that significantly limit our rights to use or license the use of our trademarks listed in this section.</p>

<p>There are no currently effective determinations of the USPTO, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, or any state trademark administrator or any court; or any pending infringement, opposition, or cancellation proceeding in which we unsuccessfully sought to prevent registration of a trademark in order to protect a trademark licensed by the franchisor. There is no pending material federal or state court litigation regarding our use or ownership rights in a trademark.</p>

<p>We know of no infringing or prior superior uses that could materially affect the use of the Marks.</p>

<p>You do not receive any rights to the Marks other than the right to use them in the operation of your Franchised Business. You must follow our rules when you use the Marks. You must use the Marks as the sole trade identification of the franchised business. You cannot use any Mark or portion of any Mark as part of any business entity name. You may not use any Mark in connection with the sale of any unauthorized services or products, or in any other manner that we do not authorize in writing. You must obtain a fictitious or assumed name registration if required by your state or local law. Any unauthorized use of the Marks by you is a breach of the Franchise Agreement and an infringement of our rights in the Marks. You must not contest the validity or ownership of the Marks, including any Marks that we license to you after you sign the Franchise Agreement. You must not assist any other person in contesting the validity or ownership of the Marks.</p>

<p>You must immediately notify us in writing when you learn about any claim of infringement, unfair competition, or similar claims about the Marks. You must not communicate with any person other than us and our counsel regarding any infringements, challenges or claims unless you are legally required to do so. However, you may communicate with your own counsel at your own expense. We are not required to take affirmative action when notified of these uses or claims. We have the sole right to control any administrative or judicial proceeding involving a trademark licensed by us. The Franchise Agreement does not require us to participate in your defense or indemnify you for expenses or damages if you are a party to an administrative or judicial proceeding involving a trademark licensed by us to you or if the proceeding is resolved unfavorable to you. You must take any actions that, in the opinion of our counsel, may be advisable to protect and maintain our interests in any proceeding or to otherwise protect and maintain our interests in the Marks.</p>

<p>If we require, you must modify or discontinue the use of any Mark and use other trademarks or service marks we designate. We do not have to reimburse you for modifying or discontinuing the use of a Mark or for substituting another trademark or service mark for a discontinued Mark. If we adopt and use new or modified Marks, you must add or replace equipment, supplies and fixtures, and you must make other modifications we designate as necessary to adapt your franchised business for the new or modified Marks. We do not reimburse you for any loss of goodwill associated with a modified or discontinued Mark.</p>

<p>You must notify us if you apply for your own trademark or service mark registrations. You must not register or seek to register as a trademark or service mark, either with the USPTO or any state or foreign country, any of the Marks or a trademark or service mark that is confusingly similar to any of our Marks.</p>

<p>Periodically, we may allow certain services or products that are not otherwise authorized for general use as a part of the System to be offered locally or regionally based on factors, including test marketing, your qualifications, and regional or local differences.</p>

Accordingly, Franchisee shall provide or offer for sale or use at the Franchised Business only those services, with the greatest diligence and care by Franchisee, that Franchisor approves (and which are not thereafter disapproved) and that comply with Franchisor&rsquo;s specifications and quality standards. If required by Franchisor, any such items or services shall be purchased only from Franchisor.

If Franchisor or an Affiliate is an Approved Supplier, Franchisee shall execute a standard form purchase or supply agreement for the items to be supplied by Franchisor or its Affiliate. If Franchisee desires to utilize any products, services or new technology that Franchisor has not approved (for products and services that require supplier approval), Franchisee shall first send Franchisor sufficient information, specifications and samples for Franchisor to determine whether the service or product complies with its standards and specifications or whether the supplier meets its Approved Supplier criteria.

<p> Franchisor shall be available to render advice, discuss problems, and offer general guidance to Franchisee by telephone and/or electronic correspondence, with respect to planning and operating the Franchised Business. Franchisor shall not charge for this service. Franchisor&rsquo;s advice or guidance to Franchisee relative to prices for products and services that, in Franchisor&rsquo;s judgment, constitutes good business practice is based upon the experience of Franchisor and its franchisees in operating Our Maids businesses and an analysis of costs and prices charged for competitive products and services. Within range, Franchisee shall have the right to change/determine the price to be charged for a particular service by the Franchised Business at the time of sale (if necessary).

<p> If provisions of this Agreement provide for periods of notice less than those required by applicable law, or provide for termination, cancellation or non-renewal other than in accordance with applicable law, Franchisor may reinstate or extend the term of this Agreement for the purpose of complying with applicable law by submitting a written notice to Franchisee without waiving any of Franchisor&rsquo;s rights under this Agreement.</p>

<p>16.4 Right of Franchisor to Discontinue Services to Franchisee</p>

<p> If Franchisee is in breach of any obligation under this Agreement, and Franchisor delivers to Franchisee a notice of termination according to Section 16.2.2, Franchisor has the right to suspend its performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement.</p>

<p>16.5 Right of Franchisor to Operate Franchised Business</p>

<p> Following the delivery of a notice of termination according to Section 16.2.2, if necessary in Franchisor&rsquo;s discretion, Franchisor shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assume the operation of the Franchised Business until such time as Franchisee corrects the breach. Franchisor may charge a management fee as stated in the Operations Manual from time to time, currently equal to $250 per person per day, and Franchisor shall be entitled to reimbursement of any expenses Franchisor incurs that are not paid out of the operating cash flow of the Franchised Business.</p>

<p>17. RIGHTS AND DUTIES UPON EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION</p>

<p>17.1 Actions to be Taken</p>

<p> Except as otherwise provided herein, upon termination or expiration, this Agreement and all rights granted hereunder to Franchisee shall terminate and Franchisee shall:</p>

<p>immediately cease to operate the Franchised Business and shall not thereafter, directly or indirectly, represent to the public or hold itself out as a present or former franchisee of Franchisor;</p>

<p>cease to use the Trade Secrets or other Confidential Information, the System and the Marks, including, without limitation, all slogans, symbols, logos, advertising materials, stationery, forms, and any other items which display or are associated with the Marks;</p>

<p>take such action as may be necessary to cancel or assign to Franchisor, at Franchisor&rsquo;s option, any assumed name or equivalent registration filed with state, city, or county authorities which contains the name &ldquo;Our Maids&rdquo; or any other Mark, and Franchisee shall furnish Franchisor with evidence satisfactory to Franchisor of compliance with this obligation within thirty (30) days after termination or expiration of this Agreement;</p>

<p>pay all sums owing to Franchisor and any Affiliate. In the event of termination for any default of Franchisee, such sums shall include, but not be limited to, all damages, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees, with respect to litigation, arbitration, appellate, or bankruptcy proceedings, unpaid Royalty Fees, loss of future Royalty Fee payments incurred by Franchisor as a result of any early termination of this Agreement, and any other amounts due to Franchisor or any Affiliate;</p>

<p>pay to Franchisor all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees, incurred by Franchisor subsequent to the termination or expiration of the Franchise in obtaining injunctive or other relief for the enforcement of any provisions of this Agreement;</p>

<p>immediately return to Franchisor the Operations Manual, Trade Secrets, and all other Confidential Information, including records, files, instructions, brochures, agreements, disclosure statements, and any and all other materials provided by Franchisor to Franchisee relating to the operation of the Franchised Business (all of which are acknowledged to be Franchisor&rsquo;s property);</p>

<p>assign all telephone listings and numbers for the Franchised Business to Franchisor and shall notify the telephone company and all listing agencies of the termination or expiration of Franchisee&rsquo;s right to use any telephone numbers or facsimile numbers associated with the Marks in any regular, classified or other telephone directory listing and shall authorize transfer of same to or at the direction of Franchisor; and</p>

<p>comply with all other applicable provisions of this Agreement.</p>

<p>17.2 Post-Termination Covenant Not to Compete</p>

<p> 17.2.1 Franchisee acknowledges that the restrictive covenants contained in this Section and in Section 17 are fair and reasonable.</p>

<p> 17.2.2 Except as otherwise approved in writing by Franchisor, neither Franchisee, nor any holder of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisee, nor any officer, director, executive, manager or member of the professional staff of Franchisee, shall, for a period of two (2) years after the expiration or termination of this Agreement, regardless of the cause of termination, either directly or indirectly: offer Competitive Business services located or operating (a) at or within a twenty-five (25) mile radius of the Franchised Business, or (b) within a twenty-five (25) mile radius of any other Our Maids Business in existence at the time of termination or expiration, or (c) any other business owned or operated by the Franchisor in existence at the time of termination or expansion;</p>

<p>solicit or otherwise attempt to induce or influence any customer or other business associate of Franchisor to terminate or modify his, her or its business relationship with Franchisor or to compete against Franchisor; or</p>

<p>In furtherance of this Section, Franchisor has the right to require certain individuals to execute standard form nondisclosure or non-competition agreements in a form the same as or similar to the Nondisclosure and Non-Competition Agreement attached as Schedule 2.</p>

<p>17.3 Unfair Competition</p>

<p> If Franchisee operates any other business, Franchisee shall not use any reproduction, counterfeit, copy or colorable imitation of the Marks, either in connection with such other business or the promotion thereof, that is likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception, or that is likely to dilute Franchisor&rsquo;s rights in the Marks. Franchisee shall not utilize any designation of origin, description or representation that falsely suggests or represents an association or connection with Franchisor. This Section is not intended as an approval of Franchisee&rsquo;s right to operate other businesses and in no way is it intended to contradict Sections 17, 17.1 or 17.2. Franchisee shall make such modifications or alterations to the Franchised Business (including changing telephone and facsimile numbers) immediately upon termination or expiration of this Agreement as may be necessary to prevent any association between Franchisor or the System and any business subsequently operated by Franchisee or others at the Franchised Business. Franchisee shall make such specific additional changes to the Franchised Business as Franchisor may reasonably request for that purpose including, without limitation, removal of all physical and structural features identifying or distinctive to the System. If Franchisee fails or refuses to comply with the requirements of this Section, Franchisor has the right to enter upon the Franchised Business for the purpose of making or causing to be made such changes as may be required, at the expense of Franchisee, which expense Franchisee shall pay upon demand.</p>

<p>17.4 Franchisor&rsquo;s Option to Purchase Certain Business Assets</p>

<p> Franchisor has the right (but not the obligation), for a period of thirty (30) days after termination or expiration of this Agreement, to purchase any or all assets of the Franchised Business including improvements, vehicles, service tools and equipment, supplies and other inventory or equipment. The purchase price shall be equal to the assets&rsquo; book value. If Franchisor elects to exercise this option to purchase, it has the right to set off all amounts due from Franchisee under this Agreement, if any, against the purchase price.</p>

<p>17.5 Survival of Certain Provisions</p>

<p> All obligations of Franchisor and Franchisee, which expressly or by their nature survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement, shall continue in full force and effect subsequent to and notwithstanding their expiration or termination and until satisfied or by their nature expire.</p>

<p>18. TRANSFERABILITY OF INTEREST</p>

<p>18.1 Transfer by Franchisor</p>

<p> This Agreement and all rights and duties hereunder are fully transferable in whole or in part by Franchisor and such rights will inure to the benefit of any person or entity to whom transferred; provided, however, that with respect to any assignment resulting in the subsequent performance by the assignee of the functions of Franchisor, the assignee shall assume the obligations of Franchisor hereunder and Franchisor shall thereafter have no liability for the performance of any obligations contained in this Agreement.</p>

<p>18.2 Transfer by Franchisee to a Third Party</p>

<p> The rights and duties of Franchisee as in this Agreement, and the Franchise herein granted, are personal to Franchisee (or its owners), and Franchisor has entered into this Agreement in reliance upon Franchisee&rsquo;s personal or collective skill and financial ability. Accordingly, neither Franchisee nor any holder of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisee may sell, assign, convey, give away, pledge, mortgage, sublicense or otherwise transfer, whether by operation of law or otherwise, any interest in this Agreement, the Franchise granted hereby, the assets of the Franchised Business or any part or all of the ownership interest in Franchisee without the prior written approval of Franchisor. Any purported transfer without such approval shall be null and void and shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement. If Franchisee is in compliance with this Agreement, Franchisor&rsquo;s consent to such transfer shall be conditioned upon the satisfaction of the following requirements:</p>

<p>Franchisee has complied with the requirements in Section 19;</p>

<p>all obligations owed to Franchisor, and all other outstanding obligations relating to the Franchised Business, are fully paid and satisfied;</p>

<p>the prospective transferee has satisfied Franchisor that it meets Franchisor&rsquo;s management, business and financial standards, and otherwise possesses the character and capabilities, including business reputation and credit rating, as Franchisor may require to demonstrate ability to conduct the Franchised Business;</p>

<p>the transferee and, if Franchisor requires, all persons owning any interest in the transferee, have executed the then-current franchise agreement for new franchisees, which may be substantially different from this Agreement, including different Royalty Fee and other material provisions, and the franchise agreement then executed shall be for the term specified in such agreement;</p>

<p>the transferee has executed a general release, in a form the same as or similar to the General Release attached as Schedule 1, of any and all claims against Franchisor and its officers, directors, shareholders, managers, members, partners, owners, employees and agents (in their corporate and individual capacities), with respect to any representations regarding the Franchise or the business conducted pursuant thereto or any other matter that may have been made to the transferee by Franchisee;</p>

<p>Franchisee has provided Franchisor with a complete copy of all contracts and agreements and related documentation between Franchisee and the prospective transferee relating to the intended sale or transfer of the Franchise;</p>

<p>Franchisee, or the transferee, has paid to Franchisor, before the transaction is completed, a transfer fee in the amount of 25% of the then current initial franchise fee;</p>

<p>the transferee has obtained all necessary consents and approvals by third parties and all applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules, ordinances, and requirements applicable to the transfer have been complied with or satisfied;</p>

<p>Franchisee has, and if Franchisee is an entity, all of the holders of a legal and beneficial interest in Franchisee have executed and delivered to Franchisor a nondisclosure and non-competition agreement in a form satisfactory to Franchisor and in substance the same as the nondisclosure and non-competition covenants contained in Sections 7 and 17; and</p>

<p>the transferee agrees that it shall complete, to Franchisor&rsquo;s satisfaction, a training program in substance similar to the initial training described in Section 8.1 prior to assuming the management of the day-to-day operation of the Franchised Business.</p>

<p>18.3 Transfer to a Controlled Entity</p>

<p> 18.3.1 If Franchisee wishes to transfer this Agreement or any interest herein to a corporation, limited liability company or other legal entity which shall be entirely owned by Franchisee (&ldquo;Controlled Entity&rdquo;), which Controlled Entity is being formed for the financial planning, tax or other convenience of Franchisee, Franchisor&rsquo;s consent to such transfer shall be conditioned upon the satisfaction of the following requirements:</p>

<p>the Controlled Entity is newly organized and its charter or articles of formation provides that its activities are confined exclusively to the operation of the Franchised Business;</p>

<p>Franchisee or all holders of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisee own all of the equity and voting power of the outstanding stock or other capital interest in the Controlled Entity;</p>

<p>all obligations of Franchisee to Franchisor or any Affiliate are fully paid and satisfied; provided, however, that neither Franchisee nor the Controlled Entity shall be required to pay a transfer fee as required according to Section 18.2(h);</p>

<p>the Controlled Entity has entered into a written agreement with Franchisor expressly assuming the obligations of this Agreement and all other agreements relating to the operation of the Franchised Business. If the consent of any other party to any such other agreement is required, Franchisee has obtained such written consent and provided the same to Franchisor prior to consent by Franchisor;</p>

<p>all holders of a legal or beneficial interest in the Controlled Entity have entered into an agreement with Franchisor jointly and severally guaranteeing the full payment of the Controlled Entity&rsquo;s obligations to Franchisor and the performance by the Controlled Entity of all the obligations of this Agreement;</p>

<p>each stock certificate or other ownership interest certificate of the Controlled Entity has conspicuously endorsed upon the face thereof a statement in a form satisfactory to Franchisor that it is held subject to, and that further assignment or transfer thereof is subject to, all restrictions imposed upon transfers and assignments by this Agreement; and</p>

<p>copies of the Controlled Entity&rsquo;s articles of incorporation or organization, bylaws, operating agreement, federal tax identification number, and other governing regulations or documents, including resolutions of the board of directors authorizing entry into this Agreement, have been promptly furnished to Franchisor. Any amendment to any such documents shall also be furnished to Franchisor immediately upon adoption.</p>

<p> 18.3.2 The term of the transferred franchise shall be the unexpired term of this Agreement, including all renewal rights, subject to any and all conditions applicable to such renewal rights.</p>

<p> 18.3.3 Franchisor&rsquo;s consent to a transfer of any interest in this Agreement, or of any ownership interest in the Franchised Business, shall not constitute a waiver of any claims Franchisor may have against the transferor or the transferee, nor shall it be deemed a waiver of Franchisor&rsquo;s right to demand compliance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>

<p>18.4 Franchisor&rsquo;s Disclosure to Transferee</p>

<p> Franchisor has the right, without liability of any kind or nature whatsoever to Franchisee, to make available for inspection by any intended transferee of Franchisee all or any part of Franchisor&rsquo;s records relating to this Agreement, the Franchised Business or to the history of the relationship of the parties hereto. Franchisee hereby specifically consents to such disclosure by Franchisor and shall release and hold Franchisor harmless from and against any claim, loss or injury resulting from an inspection of Franchisor&rsquo;s records relating to the Franchised Business by an intended transferee identified by Franchisee.</p>

<p>18.5 For-Sale Advertising</p>

<p> Franchisee shall NOT, without prior written consent of Franchisor, place in, on or upon the area of the Franchised Business, or in any communication media, any form of advertising relating to the sale of the Franchised Business or the rights granted hereunder.</p>

<p>18.6 Transfer by Death or Incapacity</p>

<p> Upon the death or Incapacity of Franchisee (if Franchisee is an individual) or any holder of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisee (if Franchisee is a business entity), the appropriate representative of such person (whether administrator, personal representative or trustee) shall, within a reasonable time not exceeding one hundred eighty (180) days following such event, transfer such individual&rsquo;s interest in the Franchised Business or in Franchisee to a third party approved by Franchisor. Such transfers, including transfers by will or inheritance, shall be subject to the conditions for assignments and transfers contained in this Agreement. During such one hundred eighty (180) day period, the Franchised Business must remain at all times under the primary management of a Designated Manager who otherwise meets Franchisor&rsquo;s management qualifications.</p>

<p> Following such a death or Incapacity of such person as described in this Section 18.6, if necessary in Franchisor&rsquo;s discretion, Franchisor shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assume operation of the Franchised Business until the deceased or incapacitated owner&rsquo;s interest is transferred to a third party approved by Franchisor. Franchisor shall be given access to the Franchised Business, even if located within Franchisee&rsquo;s or its Designated Manager&rsquo;s principal residence, and shall not be held liable for trespass or any related tort. Franchisor may charge a management fee as stated in the Operations Manual from time to time, currently equal to $250 per person per day, and Franchisor shall be entitled to reimbursement of any expenses Franchisor incurs that are not paid out of the operating cash flow of the Franchised Business.</p>

<p>19. RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL</p>

<p>19.1 Submission of Offer</p>

<p> If Franchisee, or any of its owners, proposes to sell or otherwise transfer (including a transfer by death or Incapacity according to Section 18.6) the Franchised Business (or any of its assets outside of the normal course of business), any ownership interest in Franchisee or any ownership interest in the Franchise granted hereunder, Franchisee shall obtain and deliver a bona fide, executed written offer or proposal to purchase, along with all pertinent documents including any contract or due diligence materials, to Franchisor, except with regards to a sale or transfer to a family member. The offer must apply only to an approved sale of the assets or interests listed above and may not include any other property or rights of Franchisee or any of its owners.</p>

<p>19.2 Franchisor&rsquo;s Right to Purchase</p>

<p> Franchisor shall, for thirty (30) days from the date of delivery of all such documents, have the right, exercisable by written notice to Franchisee, to purchase the offered assets or interest for the price and on the same terms and conditions contained in such offer communicated to Franchisee. Franchisor has the right to substitute cash for the fair market value of any form of payment proposed in such offer. Franchisor&rsquo;s credit shall be deemed at least equal to the credit of any proposed buyer. After providing notice to Franchisee of Franchisor&rsquo;s intent to exercise this right of first refusal, Franchisor shall have up to sixty (60) days to close the purchase. Franchisor shall be entitled to receive from Franchisee all customary representations and warranties given by Franchisee as the seller of the assets or such ownership interest or, at Franchisor&rsquo;s election, such representations and warranties contained in the proposal.</p>

<p>19.3 Non-Exercise of Right of First Refusal</p>

<p> If Franchisor does not exercise its right of first refusal within thirty (30) days from the date of delivery of all such documents, the offer or proposal may be accepted by Franchisee or any of its owners, subject to Franchisor&rsquo;s prior written approval as required by Section 18.2. Should the sale fail to close within 120 days after the offer is delivered to Franchisor, Franchisor&rsquo;s right of first refusal shall renew and be implemented in accordance with this Section.</p>

<p>19.4 Sales or Transfers to Family Excepted</p>

<p> If Franchisee proposes to sell or otherwise transfer the Franchised Business (or any of its assets outside of the normal course of business), any ownership interest in Franchisee or any ownership interest in the Franchise granted hereunder to a member of Franchisee&rsquo;s (or its owners&rsquo;) family, then the terms and conditions of this Section shall be inapplicable. Nothing in this Section 19.4 shall be construed to relieve Franchisee from full compliance with the terms and conditions of Section 18.2 prior to a sale or transfer to family according to this Section.</p>

<p>20. BENEFICIAL OWNERS OF FRANCHISEE</p>

<p> Franchisee represents, and Franchisor enters into this Agreement in reliance upon such representation, that the individual(s) identified in Schedule 6 is/are the sole holder(s) of a legal or beneficial interest (in the stated percentages) of Franchisee.</p>

<p>21. RELATIONSHIP AND INDEMNIFICATION</p>

<p>21.1 Relationship</p>

<p> This Agreement is purely a contractual relationship between the parties and does not appoint or make Franchisee an agent, legal representative, joint-venturer, partner, employee, servant, or independent contractor of Franchisor for any purpose whatsoever. Franchisee may not represent or imply to third parties that Franchisee is an agent of Franchisor, and Franchisee is in no way authorized to make any contract, agreement, warranty, or representation on behalf of Franchisor, or to create any obligation, express or implied, on Franchisor&rsquo;s behalf. During the term of this Agreement, and any extension or renewal hereof, Franchisee shall hold itself out to the public only as a franchisee and an owner of the Franchised Business operating the Franchised Business according to a franchise from Franchisor. Franchisee shall take such affirmative action as may be necessary to do so including, without limitation, exhibiting a notice of that fact in a conspicuous place on all forms, stationery or other written materials, the content of which Franchisor has the right to specify. Under no circumstances shall Franchisor be liable for any act, omission, contract, debt, nor any other obligation of Franchisee. Franchisor shall in no way be responsible for any injuries to persons or property resulting from the operation of the Franchised Business by Franchisee. Any third-party contractors and vendors retained by Franchisee to convert or construct the premises are independent contractors of Franchisee alone.</p>

<p>21.2 Standard of Care</p>

<p> This Agreement does not establish a fiduciary relationship between the parties.</p>

<p>21.3 Indemnification</p>

<p> Franchisee shall hold harmless and indemnify Franchisor, any Affiliate, all holders of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisor and all officers, directors, executives, managers, members, partners, owners, employees, agents, successors and assigns (collectively &ldquo;Franchisor Indemnities&rdquo;) from and against all losses, damages, fines, costs, expenses or liability (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and all other costs of litigation) incurred in connection with any action, suit, demand, claim, investigation or proceeding, or any settlement thereof, which arises from or is based upon Franchisee&rsquo;s (a) ownership or operation of the Franchised Business; (b) violation, breach or asserted violation or breach of any federal, state or local law, regulation or rule; (c) breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or provision of this Agreement or any other agreement between Franchisee and Franchisor (or an Affiliate); (d) defamation of Franchisor or the System; (e) acts, errors or omissions committed or incurred in connection with the Franchised Business; or (f) infringement, violation or alleged infringement or violation of any Mark, patent or copyright or any misuse of the Trade Secrets or other Confidential Information. The obligations of this Section 21.3 shall expressly survive the termination of this Agreement.</p>

<p>21.4 Right to Retain Counsel</p>

<p> Franchisee shall give Franchisor immediate notice of any such action, suit, demand, claim, investigation, or proceeding that may give rise to a claim for indemnification by a Franchisor Indemnity. Franchisor has the right to retain counsel of its own choosing in connection with any such action, suit, demand, claim, investigation or proceeding. In order to protect persons, property, Franchisor&rsquo;s reputation or the goodwill of others, Franchisor has the right to, at any time without notice, take such remedial or corrective actions as it deems expedient with respect to any action, suit, demand, claim, investigation or proceeding if, in Franchisor&rsquo;s sole judgment, there are grounds to believe any of the acts or circumstances listed above have occurred. If Franchisor&rsquo;s exercise of its rights under this Section causes any of Franchisee&rsquo;s insurers to refuse to pay a third-party claim, all cause of action and legal remedies Franchisee might have against such insurer shall automatically be assigned to Franchisor without the need for any further action on either party&rsquo;s part. Under no circumstances shall Franchisor be required or obligated to seek coverage from third parties or otherwise mitigate losses in order to maintain a claim against Franchisee. The failure to pursue such remedy or mitigate such loss shall in no way reduce the amounts recoverable by Franchisor from Franchisee. Franchisee agrees to not be a party to class action suit against the Franchisor or any of its Affiliates under any circumstances.</p>

<p>22. GENERAL CONDITIONS AND PROVISIONS</p>

<p>22.1 No Waiver</p>

<p> No failure of Franchisor to exercise any power reserved to it hereunder, or to insist upon strict compliance by Franchisee with any obligation or condition hereunder, and no custom nor practice of the parties in variance with the terms hereof, shall constitute a waiver of Franchisor&rsquo;s right to demand exact compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Waiver by Franchisor of any particular default by Franchisee shall not be binding unless in writing and executed by Franchisor and shall not affect nor impair Franchisor&rsquo;s right with respect to any subsequent default of the same or of a different nature. Subsequent acceptance by Franchisor of any payment(s) due shall not be deemed to be a waiver by Franchisor of any preceding breach by Franchisee of any terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement.</p>

<p>22.2 Injunctive Relief</p>

<p> As any breach by Franchisee of any of the restrictions contained in Sections 6, 7, and 17 would result in irreparable injury to Franchisor, and as the damages arising out of any such breach would be difficult to ascertain, in addition to all other remedies provided by law or in equity, Franchisor shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief (whether a restraining order, a preliminary injunction or a permanent injunction) against any such breach, whether actual or contemplated, without the necessity of posting security or bond and Franchisee shall be responsible for Franchisor&rsquo;s reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees incurred in pursuing the same. Franchisor&rsquo;s right to seek injunctive relief will not affect the parties&rsquo; waiver of jury trial and covenant to arbitrate all disputes in accordance with Section 23.7. Franchisor&rsquo;s rights herein shall include pursuing injunctive relief through arbitration or in a state or federal court.</p>

<p>22.3 Notices</p>

<p> All notices required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed received: (a) at the time delivered by hand to the recipient party (or to an officer, director or partner of the recipient party); (b) on the next business day after transmission by facsimile or other reasonably reliable electronic communication system; (c) two (2) business days after being sent via guaranteed overnight delivery by a commercial courier service; or (d) five (5) business days after being sent by Registered Mail, return receipt requested. Either party may change its address by a written notice sent in accordance with this Section 22.3. All notices, payments and reports required by this Agreement shall be sent to Franchisor at the following address, or at such other address as Franchisor may provide:</p>

<p> Our Maids Franchise, Inc.  Attn.: Antonio Moreno  8 The Green, Suite 14095  Dover, DE 19901</p>

<p>22.4 Cost of Enforcement or Defense</p>

<p> If Franchisor is required to enforce this Agreement in a judicial or arbitration proceeding, if it is the prevailing party, it shall be entitled to reimbursement of its costs, including reasonable accounting and attorneys&rsquo; fees, in connection with such proceeding.</p>

<p>22.5 Unlimited Guaranty and Assumption of Obligations</p>

<p> All holders of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisee of five percent (5%) or greater shall be required to execute, as of the date of this Agreement, the Unlimited Guaranty and Assumption of Obligations attached as Schedule 3, through which such holders agree to assume and discharge all of Franchisee&rsquo;s obligations under this Agreement and to be personally liable hereunder for all of the same.</p>

<p>22.6 Approvals</p>

<p> Whenever this Agreement requires the prior approval or consent of Franchisor, Franchisee shall make a timely written request to Franchisor for such approval and, except as otherwise provided herein, any approval or consent granted shall be effective only if in writing. Franchisor makes no warranties or guarantees upon which Franchisee may rely, and assumes no liability or obligation to Franchisee or any third party to which it would not otherwise be subject, by providing any waiver, approval, advice, consent or services to Franchisee in connection with this Agreement, or by reason of any neglect, delay or denial of any request for approval.</p>

<p>22.7 Entire Agreement</p>

<p> This Agreement and all exhibits to this Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties and supersede any and all prior negotiations, understandings, representations, and agreements. Nothing in this or in any related agreement, however, is intended to disclaim the representations we made in the franchise disclosure document that we furnished to you. No amendment, change or variance from this Agreement shall be binding on either party unless executed in writing by both parties.</p>

<p>22.8 Severability and Modification</p>

<p> Except as noted below, each paragraph, part, term and provision of this Agreement shall be considered severable. If any paragraph, part, term or provision herein is ruled to be unenforceable, unreasonable or invalid, such ruling shall not impair the operation of or affect the remaining portions, paragraphs, parts, terms and provisions of this Agreement, and the latter shall continue to be given full force and effect and bind the parties; and such unenforceable, unreasonable or invalid paragraphs, parts, terms or provisions shall be deemed not part of this Agreement.</p>

<p> Notwithstanding the above, each of the covenants contained in Sections 7 and 17 shall be construed as independent of any other covenant or provision of this Agreement. If all or any portion of any such covenant is held to be unenforceable, unreasonable, or invalid, then it shall be amended to provide for limitations on disclosure of Trade Secrets or other Confidential Information or on competition to the maximum extent provided or permitted by law.</p>

<p>22.9 Construction</p>

<p> All captions herein are intended solely for the convenience of the parties, and none shall be deemed to affect the meaning or construction of any provision hereof.</p>

<p>22.10 Force Majeure</p>

<p> Whenever a period of time is provided in this Agreement for either party to perform any act, except pay monies, neither party shall be liable nor responsible for any delays due to strikes, lockouts, casualties, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental regulation or control or other causes beyond the reasonable control of the parties, and the time period for the performance of such act shall be extended for the amount of time of the delay. This clause shall not result in an extension of the term of this Agreement.</p>

<p>22.11 Timing</p>

<p> Time is of the essence. Except as in Section 22.10, failure to perform any act within the time required or permitted by this Agreement shall be a material breach.</p>

<p>22.12 Withholding Payments</p>

<p> Franchisee shall not, for any reason, withhold payment of any Royalty Fees or other amounts due to Franchisor or to an Affiliate. Franchisee shall not withhold or offset any amounts, damages or other monies allegedly due to Franchisee against any amounts due to Franchisor. No endorsement or statement on any payment for less than the full amount due to Franchisor will be construed as an acknowledgment of payment in full, or an accord and satisfaction, and Franchisor has the right to accept and cash any such payment without prejudice to Franchisor&rsquo;s right to recover the full amount due, or pursue any other remedy provided in this Agreement or by law. Franchisor has the right to apply any payments made by Franchisee against any of Franchisee&rsquo;s past due indebtedness as Franchisor deems appropriate. Franchisor shall set off sums Franchisor owes to Franchisee against any unpaid debts owed by Franchisee to Franchisor.</p>

<p>22.13 Further Assurances</p>

<p> Each party to this Agreement will execute and deliver such further instruments, contracts, forms or other documents, and will perform such further acts, as may be necessary or desirable to perform or complete any term, covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement.</p>

<p>22.14 Third Party Beneficiaries</p>

<p> Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, nothing in this Agreement is intended, nor shall be deemed, to confer upon any person or legal entity other than Franchisor or Franchisee, and their respective successors and assigns as may be contemplated by this Agreement, any rights or remedies under this Agreement.</p>

<p>22.15 Multiple Originals</p>

<p> Both parties will execute multiple copies of this Agreement, and each executed copy will be deemed an original.</p>

<p>23. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</p>

<p>23.1 Choice of Law</p>

<p> Except as to claims governed by federal law, Delaware law governs all claims that in any way relate to or arise out of this Agreement or any of the dealings of the parties (&ldquo;Claims&rdquo;). However, no laws regulating the sale of franchises or governing the relationship between franchisor and franchisee shall apply unless the jurisdictional requirements of such laws are met independently of this paragraph.</p>

<p>23.2 Jurisdiction and Venue</p>

<p> You and we agree that venue and jurisdiction for any Claims, except those required to be submitted to arbitration, shall be proper solely in the state and federal court nearest to our corporate headquarters, presently located in Dover, Delaware. However, if you are an Illinois, Maryland, or Washington State resident or your franchise territory is located in Illinois, Maryland, or Washington State, you agree to bring any Claims, if at all, solely in arbitration before the American Arbitration Association in the city or county where our corporate headquarters are located.</p>

<p>23.3 Jury Waiver</p>

<p> You agree to bring any Claims, if at all, individually and you shall not join such claim with claims of any other person or entity or bring, join or participate in a class action against us.</p>

<p>23.5 Limitation of Damages</p>

<p> Franchisee and Franchisor each waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any right or claim for any punitive or exemplary damages against the other and agree that if there is a dispute with the other, each will be limited to the recovery of actual damages sustained by it including reasonable accounting and legal fees as provided in Section 22.4. Franchisee waives and disclaims any right to consequential damages in any action or claim against Franchisor concerning this Agreement or any related agreement. In any claim or action brought by Franchisee against Franchisor concerning this Agreement, Franchisee&rsquo;s contract damages shall not exceed and shall be limited to refund of Franchisee&rsquo;s Franchise Fee and Royalty Fees.</p>

<p>23.6 Limitation of Actions  You agree to bring any Claims against us, if at all, within one (1) year of the occurrence of the facts giving rise to such Claims, and that any action not brought within this period shall be barred as a claim, counterclaim, defense, or set-off.</p>

<p>23.7 Prior Notice of Claims</p>

<p> As a condition precedent to commencing an action for a Claim, you must notify us within thirty (30) days after the occurrence of the violation or breach, and failure to timely give such notice shall preclude any claim for damages.</p>

<p>23.8 Internal Dispute Resolution</p>

<p> You must first bring any Claim to our CEO, after providing notice as in Section 23.7 above. You must exhaust this internal dispute resolution procedure before you may bring your Claim before a third party.</p>

<p>23.9 Mediation and Arbitration</p>

<p> Before you may bring any Claim against us, you agree to try for a period of 60 days to mediate such claim before a mutually agreed to mediator in the city or county where our headquarters are located. If we cannot mutually agree on a mediator, you and we agree to use the mediation services of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), and split any AAA and mediator fees equally.</p>

<p> If mediation is unsuccessful and you decide to pursue a legal claim against us, you agree to bring such claim solely in binding arbitration conducted in the city or county where our headquarters is located, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. The proceedings will be held by a single arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding upon the parties. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having personal and subject matter jurisdiction.</p>

<p>23.10 Waiver of Bond</p>

<p>You agree that if we are forced to bring suit to enforce any provision of this Agreement, you agree to waive any requirement that we post bond to obtain a temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunction to enforce these duties.</p>

<p>23.11 Attorney Fees</p>

<p> If we are the substantially prevailing party as to any Claims, you agree to reimburse our costs and attorney fees incurred in pursuing or defending the Claims.</p>

<p>23.12 Third Party Beneficiaries</p>

<p>Our officers, directors, members, shareholders, agents, and employees are express third-party beneficiaries of the terms of the Dispute Resolution provisions contained herein.</p>

<p> Title:   __ SCHEDULE 2 TO THE FRANCHISE AGREEMENT NONDISCLOSURE AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT</p>

<p> This &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo; made as of the  _ day of     _, 20 _, is by and between      , (&ldquo;Franchisee,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us,&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) and        (&ldquo;Individual,&rdquo; &ldquo;you,&rdquo; or &ldquo;your&rdquo;).</p>

<p>W I T N E S S E T H:</p>

<p> WHEREAS, Franchisee is a party to that certain Franchise Agreement dated      , 20__ (&ldquo;Franchise Agreement&rdquo;) by and between Franchisee and the Franchisor, Our Maids Franchise, Inc. (&ldquo;Company&rdquo;); and</p>

<p> WHEREAS, Franchisee desires Individual to have access to and review certain Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information, which are more particularly described below; and</p>

<p> WHEREAS, Franchisee is required by the Franchise Agreement to have Individual execute this Agreement prior to providing Individual access to said Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information; and   WHEREAS, Individual understands the necessity of not disclosing any such information to any other party or using such information to compete against Company, Franchisee or any other franchisee of Company in any business (i) that offers or provides (or grants franchises or licenses to others to operate a business that offers or provides) products and services the same as or similar to those provided by Franchisee or (ii) in which Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information (as defined below) could be used to the disadvantage of Franchisee, or Company, any affiliate of Company or Company&rsquo;s other franchisees (hereinafter, &ldquo;Competitive Business&rdquo;); provided, however, that the term &ldquo;Competitive Business&rdquo; shall not apply to any business operated by Franchisee under a Franchise Agreement with Company.</p>

<p> NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and undertakings stated here, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereby mutually agree as follows:</p>

<p> 1. Trade Secrets and Confidential Information</p>

<p> Individual understands Franchisee possesses and will possess Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information that are important to its business.</p>

<p> a) For the purposes of this Agreement, a &ldquo;Trade Secret&rdquo; is information in any form (including, but not limited to, materials and techniques, technical or non-technical data, formulas, patterns, recipes compilations, programs, devices, methods, techniques, drawings, processes, financial data, financial plans, product plans, passwords, lists of actual or potential customers or suppliers) related to or used in the Our Maids Business that is not commonly known by or available to the public and that information: (i) derives economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (ii) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.</p>

<p> b) For the purposes of this Agreement &ldquo;Confidential Information&rdquo; means technical and non-technical information used in or related to Our Maids that is not commonly known by or available to the public, including, without limitation, Trade Secrets and information contained in the Operations Manual and training guides and materials. In addition, any other information identified as confidential when delivered by Franchisee shall be deemed Confidential Information. Confidential Information shall not include, however, any information that: (i) is now or subsequently becomes generally available to the public through no fault of Individual; (ii) Individual can demonstrate was rightfully in its possession, without obligation of nondisclosure, prior to disclosure according to this Agreement; (iii) is independently developed without the use of any Confidential Information; or (iv) is rightfully obtained from a third party who has the right, without obligation of nondisclosure, to transfer or disclose such information.</p>

<p> c) Any information expressly designated by Company or Franchisee as &ldquo;Trade Secrets&rdquo; or &ldquo;Confidential Information&rdquo; shall be deemed such for all purposes of this Agreement, but the absence of designation shall not relieve Individual of his or her obligations hereunder in respect of information otherwise constituting Trade Secrets or Confidential Information. Individual understands Franchisee&rsquo;s providing of access to the Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information creates a relationship of confidence and trust between Individual and Franchisee with respect to the Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information.</p>

<p> 2. Confidentiality/Non-Disclosure</p>

<p> a) Individual shall not communicate or divulge to (or use for the benefit of) any other person, firm, association, or corporation, with the sole exception of Franchisee, now or at any time in the future, any Trade Secrets or other Confidential Information. At all times from the date of this Agreement, Individual must take all steps reasonably necessary and/or requested by Franchisee to ensure that the Confidential Information and Trade Secrets are kept confidential according to the terms of this Agreement. Individual must comply with all applicable policies, procedures and practices that Franchisee has established and may establish from time to time with regard to the Confidential Information and Trade Secrets.</p>

<p> b) Individual&rsquo;s obligations under paragraph 2(a) of this Agreement shall continue in effect after termination of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee, regardless of the reason or reasons for termination, and whether such termination is voluntary or involuntary, and Franchisee is entitled to communicate Individual&rsquo;s obligations under this Agreement to any future customer or employer to the extent deemed necessary by Franchisee for protection of its rights hereunder and regardless of whether Individual or any of its affiliates or assigns becomes an investor, partner, joint venturer, broker, distributor or the like in an Our Maids Business.</p>

<p> 3. Non-Competition</p>

<p> a) During the term of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee and for a period of two (2) years after the expiration or termination of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee, regardless of the cause of expiration or termination, Individual shall not, directly or indirectly, divert or attempt to divert any business or customer of Franchisee or the Company to any Competitive Business, by direct or indirect inducement or otherwise, or do or perform, directly or indirectly, any other act injurious or prejudicial to the goodwill associated with the Company&rsquo;s service mark &ldquo;Our Maids&rdquo; and such other trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, designs, graphics, logos, emblems, insignia, fascia, slogans, drawings and other commercial symbols as the Company designates to be used in connection with Our Maids or the Company&rsquo;s uniform standards, methods, procedures and specifications for the establishment and operation of an Our Maids business.     b) During the term of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, regardless of the cause of termination, Individual shall not, directly or indirectly, offer Competitive Business services anywhere within a TWENTY FIVE (25) mile radius of any Our Maids location without the express written consent of Franchisee and the Company.</p>

<p> c) During the term of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, regardless of the cause of termination, Individual shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit or otherwise attempt to induce or influence any business associate of Franchisee, Company or any other Our Maids Business to compete against, or terminate or modify his, her or its business relationship with, Franchisee, Company or any other Our Maids Business.</p>

<p> 4. Reasonableness of Restrictions</p>

<p> Individual acknowledges that each of the terms stated here, including the restrictive covenants, is fair and reasonable and is reasonably required for the protection of Franchisee, Company, and Company&rsquo;s Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information, the Company&rsquo;s business system, network of franchises and trade and service marks, and Individual waives any right to challenge these restrictions as being overly broad, unreasonable or otherwise unenforceable. If, however, a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any such restriction is unreasonable or unenforceable, then Individual shall submit to the reduction of any such activity, time period or geographic restriction necessary to enable the court to enforce such restrictions to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. It is the desire and intent of the parties that the provisions of this Agreement shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies applied in any jurisdiction where enforcement is sought.</p>

<p> 5. Relief for Breaches of Confidentiality, Non-Solicitation, and Non-Competition</p>

<p> Individual further acknowledges that an actual or threatened violation of the covenants contained in this Agreement will cause Franchisee and Company immediate and irreparable harm, damage and injury that cannot be fully compensated for by an award of damages or other remedies at law. Accordingly, Franchisee and/or Company shall be entitled, as a matter of right, to an injunction from any court of competent jurisdiction restraining any further violation by Individual of this Agreement without any requirement to show any actual damage or to post any bond or other security. Such right to an injunction shall be cumulative and in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights and remedies that Franchisee and Company may have at law or in equity.</p>

<p> 6. Dispute Resolution</p>

<p> a) Choice of Law. Except as to claims governed by federal law, the local law where the Franchised Business is located governs all claims that in any way relate to or arise out of this Agreement or any of the dealings of the parties (&ldquo;Claims&rdquo;). However, no laws regulating the sale of franchises or governing the relationship between franchisor and franchisee shall apply unless the jurisdictional requirements of such laws are met independently of this paragraph.</p>

<p> b) Jurisdiction and Venue. You and we agree that venue and jurisdiction for any Claims, except those required to be submitted to arbitration, shall be proper solely in the state and federal court nearest to our corporate headquarters.</p>

<p> c) Jury Waiver. In any trial between any of the parties as to any Claims, you and we agree to waive our rights to a jury trial and instead have such action tried by a judge.</p>

<p> d) Class Action Waiver. You agree to bring any Claims, if at all, individually and you shall not join such claim with claims of any other person or entity or bring, join or participate in a class action against us.  e) Punitive Damages Waiver. As to any Claims, you and we agree to waive our rights, if any, to seek or recover punitive damages.</p>

<p> f) Limitation of Actions. You agree to bring any Claims against us, if at all, within one (1) year of the occurrence of the facts giving rise to such Claims, and that any action not brought within this period shall be barred as a claim, counterclaim, defense, or set-off.</p>

<p>g) Prior Notice of Claims. As a condition precedent to commencing an action for a Claim, you must notify us within thirty (30) days after the occurrence of the violation or breach, and failure to timely give such notice shall preclude any claim for damages.</p>

<p>h) Internal Dispute Resolution. You must first bring any Claim to our CEO, after providing notice as in Section 6(g) above. You must exhaust this internal dispute resolution procedure before you may bring your Claim before a third party.</p>

<p> i) Mediation and Arbitration. Before you may bring any Claim against us court, you agree to try for a period of 60 days to mediate such claim before a mutually agreed to mediator in the city or county where our headquarters are located. If we cannot mutually agree on a mediator, you and we agree to use the mediation services of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), and split any AAA and mediator fees equally.</p>

<p> If mediation is unsuccessful and you decide to pursue a legal claim against us, you agree to bring such claim solely in binding arbitration conducted in the city or county of our headquarters in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. The proceedings will be held by a single arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding upon the parties. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having personal and subject matter jurisdiction.</p>

<p>j) Waiver of Bond. You agree that if we are forced to bring suit to enforce any provision of this Agreement, you agree to waive any requirement that we post bond to obtain a temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunction to enforce these duties.</p>

<p>k) Attorney Fees. If we are the substantially prevailing party as to any Claims, you agree to reimburse our costs and attorney fees incurred in pursuing or defending the Claims.</p>

<p>LEASE ADDENDUM</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>1. Use. Tenant is a franchisee of Franchisor. The Leased Premises shall be used only for the operation of an Our Maids business (or any name authorized by Franchisor).</p>

<p>2. Notice of Default and Opportunity To Cure. Landlord shall provide Franchisor with copies of any written notice of default (&ldquo;Default&rdquo;) given to Tenant under the Lease, and Landlord grants to Franchisor the option (but not the obligation) to cure any Default under the Lease (should Tenant fail to do so) within 10 days after the expiration of the period in which Tenant may cure the Default.</p>

<p>3. Termination of Lease. Landlord shall copy Franchisor on any notice of termination of the Lease. If Landlord terminates the Lease for Tenant&rsquo;s Default, Franchisor shall have the option to enter into a new Lease with Landlord on the same terms and conditions as the terminated Lease, subject to Landlord&rsquo;s approval in its reasonable discretion. To exercise this option, Franchisor must notify Landlord within 10 days after Franchisor receives notice of the termination of the Lease.</p>

<p>4. Termination of Franchise Agreement. If the Franchise Agreement between Franchisor and Tenant is terminated during the term of the Lease, then upon the written request of Franchisor, Landlord and Tenant consent to allow Franchisor to assume any existing term of the Lease (the &ldquo;Assumption&rdquo;), provided that any and all defaults have been cured and all payments due under the Lease are current, and to enter into a written agreement providing for such Assumption. In the event of an Assumption, Landlord will deliver possession of the Leased Premises to Franchisor free and clear of any rights of the Tenant or any third party. Landlord further consents to give Franchisor the right, following the Assumption, to assign its interest in the Lease or to sublet the Leased Premises to another franchisee of Franchisor with reasonable consent from the Landlord.</p>

<p>5. Assignment and Subletting. Notwithstanding any provision of the Lease to the contrary, Tenant shall have the right to assign or sublet the Lease to Franchisor, provided that no such assignment or sublease shall relieve Tenant or any guarantor of liability under the Lease.

<p>Minn. Stat. &sect;80C.21 and Minn. Rule 2860.4400(J) prohibit the franchisor from requiring litigation to be conducted outside Minnesota, requiring waiver of a jury trial, or requiring the franchisee to consent to liquidated damages, termination penalties or judgment notes. In addition, nothing in the Franchise Disclosure Document or agreements can abrogate or reduce (1) any of the franchisee&rsquo;s rights as provided for in Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 80C, or (2) franchisee&rsquo;s rights to any procedure, forum, or remedies provided for by the laws of the jurisdiction.</p>

<p>With respect to franchises governed by Minnesota law, the franchisor will comply with Minn. Stat. Sec. 80C.14 Subds. 3, 4, and 5 which require (except in certain specified cases), that a franchisee be given 90 days&rsquo; notice of termination (with 60 days to cure) and 180 days&rsquo; notice for non-renewal of the franchise agreement and that consent to the transfer of the franchise will not be unreasonably withheld.</p>

<p>Minnesota considers it unfair to not protect the franchisee&rsquo;s right to use the trademarks. Refer to Minnesota Statutes 80C.12, Subd. 1(g).</p>

<p>Minnesota Rules 2860.4400(D) prohibits a franchisor from requiring a franchisee to assent to a general release.</p>

<p>If any of the terms of the Franchise Agreement are inconsistent with the terms below, the terms below control.</p>

<p>In the event of a conflict of laws, the provisions of the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, Chapter 19.100 RCW will prevail.</p>

<p>RCW 19.100.180 may supersede the franchise agreement in your relationship with the franchisor including the areas of termination and renewal of your franchise. There may also be court decisions which may supersede the franchise agreement in your relationship with the franchisor including the areas of termination and renewal of your franchise.</p>

<p>In any arbitration or mediation involving a franchise purchased in Washington, the arbitration or mediation site will be either in the state of Washington, or in a place mutually agreed upon at the time of the arbitration or mediation, or as determined by the arbitrator or mediator at the time of arbitration or mediation. In addition, if litigation is not precluded by the franchise agreement, a franchisee may bring an action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with the sale of franchises, or a violation of the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, in Washington.</p>

<p>A release or waiver of rights executed by a franchisee may not include rights under the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act or any rule or order thereunder except when executed pursuant to a negotiated settlement after the agreement is in effect and where the parties are represented by independent counsel. Provisions such as those which unreasonably restrict or limit the statute of limitations period for claims under the Act, or rights or remedies under the Act such as a right to a jury trial, may not be enforceable.</p>

<p>Transfer fees are collectable to the extent that they reflect the franchisor&rsquo;s reasonable estimated or actual costs in effecting a transfer.</p>

<p>Pursuant to RCW 49.62.020, a noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable against an employee, including an employee of a franchisee, unless the employee&rsquo;s earnings from the party seeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed $100,000 per year (an amount that will be adjusted annually for inflation). In addition, a noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable against an independent contractor of a franchisee under RCW 49.62.030 unless the independent contractor&rsquo;s earnings from the party seeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed $250,000 per year (an amount that will be adjusted annually for inflation). As a result, any provisions contained in the franchise agreement or elsewhere that conflict with these limitations are void and unenforceable in Washington.</p>

<p>RCW 49.62.060 prohibits a franchisor from restricting, restraining, or prohibiting a franchisee from (i) soliciting or hiring any employee of a franchisee of the same franchisor or (ii) soliciting or hiring any employee of the franchisor. As a result, any such provisions contained in the franchise agreement or elsewhere are void and unenforceable in Washington.</p>

<p>Section 17.2.2(a) is modified to also provide that the post-term non-compete will only apply to a 25 mile radius of your Franchised Business.</p>

<p>Section 21.3 is modified to also provide that the indemnification does not extend to liabilities resulting from the gross negligence of willful misconduct of any Franchisor indemnitee.</p>

<p>RCW 49.62.060 prohibits a franchisor from restricting, restraining, or prohibiting a franchisee from (i) soliciting or hiring any employee of a franchisee of the same franchisor or (ii) soliciting or hiring any employee of the franchisor. As a result, any such provisions contained in the franchise agreement or elsewhere are void and unenforceable in Washington.</p>

<p>A release or waiver of rights signed by the franchisee shall not include rights under the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act except when executed according to a negotiated settlement after the agreement is in effect and where the parties are represented by independent counsel. Provisions such as those that unreasonably restrict or limit the statute of limitations period for claims under the Act, rights or remedies under the Act such as a right to a jury trial may not be enforceable.</p>

<p> MINNESOTA ADDENDUM TO THE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT</p>

<p>Minn. Stat. &sect;80C.21 and Minn. Rule 2860.4400(J) prohibit the franchisor from requiring litigation to be conducted outside Minnesota, requiring waiver of a jury trial, or requiring the franchisee to consent to liquidated damages, termination penalties or judgment notes. In addition, nothing in the Franchise Disclosure Document or agreements can abrogate or reduce (1) any of the franchisee&rsquo;s rights as provided for in Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 80C, or (2) franchisee&rsquo;s rights to any procedure, forum, or remedies provided for by the laws of the jurisdiction.</p>

<p>With respect to franchises governed by Minnesota law, the franchisor will comply with Minn. Stat. Sec. 80C.14 Subds. 3, 4, and 5 which require (except in certain specified cases), that a franchisee be given 90 days&rsquo; notice of termination (with 60 days to cure) and 180 days&rsquo; notice for non-renewal of the franchise agreement and that consent to the transfer of the franchise will not be unreasonably withheld.</p>

<p>RCW 19.100.180 may supersede the franchise agreement in your relationship with the franchisor including the areas of termination and renewal of your franchise. There may also be court decisions which may supersede the franchise agreement in your relationship with the franchisor including the areas of termination and renewal of your franchise.</p>

<p>In any arbitration or mediation involving a franchise purchased in Washington, the arbitration or mediation site will be either in the state of Washington, or in a place mutually agreed upon at the time of the arbitration or mediation, or as determined by the arbitrator or mediator at the time of arbitration or mediation.

<p>A release or waiver of rights executed by a franchisee may not include rights under the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act or any rule or order thereunder except when executed pursuant to a negotiated settlement after the agreement is in effect and where the parties are represented by independent counsel. Provisions such as those which unreasonably restrict or limit the statute of limitations period for claims under the Act, or rights or remedies under the Act such as a right to a jury trial, may not be enforceable.</p>

<p>Transfer fees are collectable to the extent that they reflect the franchisor&rsquo;s reasonable estimated or actual costs in effecting a transfer.</p>

<p>Pursuant to RCW 49.62.020, a noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable against an employee, including an employee of a franchisee, unless the employee&rsquo;s earnings from the party seeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed $100,000 per year (an amount that will be adjusted annually for inflation).

<p>RCW 49.62.060 prohibits a franchisor from restricting, restraining, or prohibiting a franchisee from (i) soliciting or hiring any employee of a franchisee of the same franchisor or (ii) soliciting or hiring any employee of the franchisor. As a result, any such provisions contained in the franchise agreement or elsewhere are void and unenforceable in Washington.</p>

<p>A release or waiver of rights signed by the franchisee shall not include rights under the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act except when executed according to a negotiated settlement after the agreement is in effect and where the parties are represented by independent counsel.

That Law further provides that 90 days&rsquo; prior written notice of a proposed termination, etc. must be given to the dealer.

<p>How to Use This Franchise Disclosure Document</p>

<p>Here are some questions you may be asking about buying a franchise and tips on how to find more information:</p>

<p>What You Need To Know About Franchising Generally</p>

<p>Continuing responsibility to pay fees. You may have to pay royalties and other fees even if you are losing money.    Business model can change. The franchise agreement may allow the franchisor to change its manuals and business model without your consent. These changes may require you to make additional investments in your franchise business or may harm your franchise business.    Supplier restrictions. You may have to buy or lease items from the franchisor or a limited group of suppliers the franchisor designates. These items may be more expensive than similar items you could buy on your own.    Operating restrictions. The franchise agreement may prohibit you from operating a similar business during the term of the franchise. There are usually other restrictions. Some examples may include controlling your location, your access to customers, what you sell, how you market, and your hours of operation.    Competition from franchisor. Even if the franchise agreement grants you a territory, the franchisor may have the right to compete with you in your territory.    Renewal. Your franchise agreement may not permit you to renew. Even if it does, you may have to sign a new agreement with different terms and conditions in order to continue to operate your franchise business.    When your franchise ends. The franchise agreement may prohibit you from operating a similar business after your franchise ends even if you still have obligations to your landlord or other creditors.    Some States Require Registration   Your state may have a franchise law, or other law, that requires franchisors to register before offering or selling franchises in the state. Registration does not mean that the state recommends the franchise or has verified the information in this document. To find out if your state has a registration requirement, or to contact your state, use the agency information in Exhibit A.    Your state also may have laws that require special disclosures or amendments be made to your franchise agreement. If so, you should check the State Specific Addenda. See the Table of Contents for the location of the State Specific Addenda.  </p>

<p>Special Risks to Consider About This Franchise   Certain states require that the following risk(s) be highlighted:     1. Out-of-State Dispute Resolution. The franchise agreement requires you to resolve disputes with the franchisor by mediation, arbitration and/or litigation only in Delaware. Out-of-state mediation, arbitration, or litigation may force you to accept a less favorable settlement for disputes. It may also cost more to mediate, arbitrate, or litigate with the franchisor in Delaware than in your own state.</p>

<p> 2. Short Operating History. The franchisor is at an early stage of development and has a limited operating history. This franchise is likely to be a riskier investment than a franchise in a system with a longer operating history.</p>

<p> 3. Financial Condition. The Franchisor&rsquo;s financial condition as reflected in its financial statements (see Item 21) calls into question the Franchisor&rsquo;s financial ability to provide services and support to you.</p>

<p>Certain states may require other risks to be highlighted. Check the &ldquo;State Specific Addenda&rdquo; (if any) to see whether your state requires other risks to be highlighted.</p>

<p>MICHIGAN ADDENDUM TO THE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT</p>

<p>THE STATE OF MICHIGAN PROHIBITS CERTAIN UNFAIR PROVISIONS THAT ARE SOMETIMES IN FRANCHISE DOCUMENTS. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS ARE IN THESE FRANCHISE DOCUMENTS, THE PROVISIONS ARE VOID AND CANNOT BE ENFORCED AGAINST YOU:</p>

<p>(a) A prohibition on the right of a franchisee to join an association of franchisees.</p>

<p>(b) A requirement that a franchisee assent to a release, assignment, novation, waiver, or estoppel which deprives a franchisee of rights and protections provided in this act. This shall not preclude a franchisee, after entering into a franchise agreement, from settling any and all claims.</p>

<p>(c) A provision that permits a franchisor to terminate a franchise prior to the expiration of its term except for good cause. Good cause shall include the failure of the franchisee to comply with any lawful provision of the franchise agreement and to cure such failure after being given written notice thereof and a reasonable opportunity, which in no event need be more than 30 days, to cure such failure.</p>

<p>(d) A provision that permits a franchisor to refuse to renew a franchise without fairly compensating the franchisee by repurchase or other means for the fair market value at the time of expiration of the franchisee&rsquo;s inventory, supplies, equipment, fixtures, and furnishings. Personalized materials which have no value to the franchisor and inventory, supplies, equipment, fixtures, and furnishings not reasonably required in the conduct of the franchise business are not subject to compensation. This subsection applies only if: (i) The term of the franchise is less than 5 years and (ii) the franchisee is prohibited by the franchise or other agreement from continuing to conduct substantially the same business under another trademark, service mark, trade name, logo type, advertising, or other commercial symbol in the same area subsequent to the expiration of the franchise or the franchisee does not receive at least 6 months advance notice of franchisor&rsquo;s intent not to renew the franchise.</p>

<p>(e) A provision that permits the franchisor to refuse to renew a franchise on terms generally available to other franchisees of the same class or type under similar circumstances. This section does not require a renewal provision.</p>

<p>(f) A provision requiring that arbitration or litigation be conducted outside this state. This shall not preclude the franchisee from entering into an agreement, at the time of arbitration, to conduct arbitration at a location outside this state.</p>

<p>(g) A provision which permits a franchisor to refuse to permit a transfer of ownership of a franchise, except for good cause. This subdivision does not prevent a franchisor from exercising a right of first refusal to purchase the franchise. Good cause shall include, but is not limited to: (i) The failure of the proposed transferee to meet the franchisor&rsquo;s then current reasonable qualifications or standards; (ii) The fact that the proposed transferee is a competitor of the franchisor or subfranchisor; (iii) The unwillingness of the proposed transferee to agree in writing to comply with all lawful obligations; (iv) The failure of the franchisee or proposed transferee to pay any sums owing to the franchisor or to cure any default in the franchise agreement existing at the time of the proposed transfer.</p>

<p>(h) A provision that requires the franchisee to resell to the franchisor items that are not uniquely identified with the franchisor. This subdivision does not prohibit a provision that grants to a franchisor a right of first refusal to purchase the assets of a franchise on the same terms and conditions as a bona fide third party willing and able to purchase those assets, nor does this subdivision prohibit a provision that grants the franchisor the right to acquire the assets of a franchise for the market or appraised value of such assets if the franchisee has breached the lawful provisions of the franchise agreement and has failed to cure the breach in the manner provided in subdivision (c).</p>

<p>(i) A provision which permits the franchisor to directly or indirectly convey, assign, or otherwise transfer its obligation to fulfill contractual obligations to the franchisee unless provision has been made for providing the required contractual services.</p>

<p>THE FACT THAT THERE IS A NOTICE OF THIS OFFERING ON FILE WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOES NOT CONSTITUTE APPROVAL, RECOMMENDATION, OR ENDORSEMENT BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.</p>

<p>B. AREA DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT</p>

<p>Note 2-The low-end comprises of the low-end estimate from the Item 7.A table, less the $20,000 initial franchise fee, as it is included in the Area Development Fee ($42,500 - $20,000 = $22,500). The high-end comprises of the high-end estimate from the Item 7.A table, less the $20,000 initial franchise fee, as it is included in the Area Development Fee ($55,250 - $20,000 = $35,250).</p>

<p>The estimates in this Chart 7(B) assume that you will be entering into an Area Development Agreement for the right to open and operate three to five Franchised Businesses within a Development Area and the cost of opening the first Franchised Business.</p>

<p>The Area Development Fee ranges from $40,000 to $60,000 for three to five territories, as explained in Item 5 above.

You must maintain your computer systems in good working order and must replace, update, or upgrade your hardware systems as we require.

<p> As you may work from your home and a vehicle, or any office location in your Territory, we do not provide site selection assistance. (Franchise Agreement, Section 8.2).</p>

<p>Typical Length of Time Before Operation</p>

<p> We estimate that the typical length of time between the signing of the Franchise Agreement and the opening of the franchise is approximately 10-30 days. Factors that may affect your beginning operations include the ability to secure permits, obtain equipment, and hire and train employees. You must open your franchised business and be operational within 60 days from executing the Franchise Agreement. Nonetheless, we reserve the right to grant extensions to the Time Before Operations period at our sole and absolute discretion, we are in no way obligated to consider such extensions in any case. (Section 5.4 of the Franchise Agreement).</p>

<p>Training</p>

<p> We provide you with an initial training program before you commence operations, covering the areas identified in the below table. Up to 2 employees of your choosing may also attend at your option. The time frames provided in the chart are estimates of the time it will take to complete training. We do not charge for the initial training. You must pay for all travel costs and living expenses for yourself and any of your attendees. If you replace your helper s/he must attend our training program. You will be charged for additional training, as provided for in Item 6. Your franchised business must at all times either be under your day-to-day supervision as the Owner/Operator, or by an approved manager who has satisfactorily completed our training program. Additional training shall be at a cost of $250 per person per day if at our location, or $250 per person per day if the training is at your location (plus costs of travel, air fare and incidentals). (Sections 8.1, 8.3, and 8.4 of the Franchise Agreement).</p>

<p> Note 1- Training Location- This training is offered virtually via Zoom.</p>

<p> All persons attending the initial training program must complete the program to our satisfaction. If you cannot complete the program to our satisfaction, we may terminate the Franchise Agreement. (Sections 8.1 and 8.3 of the Franchise Agreement).</p>

<p>The following instructor teaches our initial training program: Antonio Moreno. We describe the nature of the Instructor&rsquo;s experience in Item 2.  We set forth the length of the Instructor&rsquo;s experience in the industry and with the franchisor below:</p>

<p>*Includes years of experience with any of our affiliates. The principal instructional materials will consist of the Operations Manual. From time to time, we may provide and if we do, have the right to require that you attend ongoing training programs, seminars, or webinars during the term of this Agreement, at your expense of $250 per person per day if ongoing training is at our location, or $250 per person per day (plus hotel, air fare and other expenses incurred by our trainer) if ongoing training is at Franchisee&rsquo;s location.

<p>ITEM 12. TERRITORY</p>

<p>The territory will be for a specific geographic region that we define and approve by radius, zip codes, natural, or political boundaries as set forth in the Franchise Agreement.</p>

<p>A territory will normally include an area of 200,000 households.</p>

<p>We would not normally have occasion to approve relocation of the franchised business because you will work from your home and a vehicle.</p>

<p>We would not normally grant to you approval to open an additional outlet within your territory, but may grant you additional franchise territories if we feel you have the time, energy, capital, and management structure to be able to successfully open and operate another territory.</p>

<p>We do not grant you options, rights of first refusal, or similar rights to acquire additional franchises.</p>

<p>You will receive an exclusive territory, meaning a geographic area within which we promise not to establish either a company-owned or franchised outlet selling the same or similar goods or services under the same or similar trademarks or service marks.</p>

<p>Continuation of your territorial rights does not depend on achieving a certain sales volume, market penetration, or other contingency, and we may not alter your franchise territory, even if there is a population increase in your territory.</p>

<p>We or an affiliate reserves the right to use other channels of distribution, such as the Internet, catalog sales, telemarketing, or other direct marketing sales, to solicit or accept orders within your territory using our principal trademarks, however, we would normally direct inquiries for services from within your territory to your outlet.</p>

<p>We or an affiliate also reserves the right to use other channels of distribution, such as the Internet, catalog sales, telemarketing, or other direct marketing sales, to make sales within your territory of products or services under trademarks different from the ones that you will use under the franchise agreement.</p>

<p>We are not obligated to pay compensation to you for soliciting or accepting orders from inside your territory.</p>

<p>You and other franchisees may not solicit (but may accept) orders from consumers outside of your territory, including through the use of other channels of distribution, such as the Internet, catalog sales, telemarketing, or other direct marketing, but you may engage in internet and social media marketing pursuant to our guidelines which such marketing may extend outside your territory. We also reserve the right to implement cross-territorial protocols and other guidelines applicable to such situations as group advertising buys by multiple franchisees which may extend into multiple territories, solicitation of orders of individuals who may reside in one territory, yet work in another, and other cross-territorial situations. You agree to abide by any such cross-territorial protocols.</p>

<p>Neither we nor an affiliate operates, franchises, or has plans to operate or franchise a business under a different trademark which such business sells or will sell goods or services similar to those you will offer, but we reserve the right to do so.</p>

<p>Area Developers:</p>

<p> Under the Area Development Agreement (the &ldquo;ADA&rdquo;), you will develop, open and operate multiple outlets within a defined Development Area (the &ldquo;Development Area&rdquo;). We determine the Development Area using the same criteria that we use in deciding the Territory for a Business.</p>

<p>ITEM 13. TRADEMARKS</p>

<p>The franchise agreement licenses to you the right to use the following principal trademarks (&ldquo;Marks&rdquo;) registered or applied for with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (&ldquo;USPTO&rdquo;):</p>

<p></p>

<p> We do not have a federal registration for our principal trademark. SERIAL/ REGISTRATION NO. 7036264: PRINCIPAL REGISTER: REGISTRATION DATE, APRIL 25, 2023.</p>

<p>There are no currently effective agreements that significantly limit our rights to use or license the use of our trademarks listed in this section.</p>

<p>There are no currently effective determinations of the USPTO, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, or any state trademark administrator or any court; or any pending infringement, opposition, or cancellation proceeding in which we unsuccessfully sought to prevent registration of a trademark in order to protect a trademark licensed by the franchisor. There is no pending material federal or state court litigation regarding our use or ownership rights in a trademark.</p>

<p>We know of no infringing or prior superior uses that could materially affect the use of the Marks.</p>

<p>You do not receive any rights to the Marks other than the right to use them in the operation of your Franchised Business. You must follow our rules when you use the Marks. You must use the Marks as the sole trade identification of the franchised business. You cannot use any Mark or portion of any Mark as part of any business entity name. You may not use any Mark in connection with the sale of any unauthorized services or products, or in any other manner that we do not authorize in writing. You must obtain a fictitious or assumed name registration if required by your state or local law. Any unauthorized use of the Marks by you is a breach of the Franchise Agreement and an infringement of our rights in the Marks. You must not contest the validity or ownership of the Marks, including any Marks that we license to you after you sign the Franchise Agreement. You must not assist any other person in contesting the validity or ownership of the Marks.</p>

<p>You must immediately notify us in writing when you learn about any claim of infringement, unfair competition, or similar claims about the Marks. You must not communicate with any person other than us and our counsel regarding any infringements, challenges or claims unless you are legally required to do so. However, you may communicate with your own counsel at your own expense. We are not required to take affirmative action when notified of these uses or claims. We have the sole right to control any administrative or judicial proceeding involving a trademark licensed by us. The Franchise Agreement does not require us to participate in your defense or indemnify you for expenses or damages if you are a party to an administrative or judicial proceeding involving a trademark licensed by us to you or if the proceeding is resolved unfavorable to you. You must take any actions that, in the opinion of our counsel, may be advisable to protect and maintain our interests in any proceeding or to otherwise protect and maintain our interests in the Marks.</p>

<p>If we require, you must modify or discontinue the use of any Mark and use other trademarks or service marks we designate. We do not have to reimburse you for modifying or discontinuing the use of a Mark or for substituting another trademark or service mark for a discontinued Mark. If we adopt and use new or modified Marks, you must add or replace equipment, supplies and fixtures, and you must make other modifications we designate as necessary to adapt your franchised business for the new or modified Marks. We do not reimburse you for any loss of goodwill associated with a modified or discontinued Mark.</p>

<p>You must notify us if you apply for your own trademark or service mark registrations. You must not register or seek to register as a trademark or service mark, either with the USPTO or any state or foreign country, any of the Marks or a trademark or service mark that is confusingly similar to any of our Marks.</p>

<p>ITEM 15. OBLIGATION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ACTUAL OPERATION OF THE FRANCHISE BUSINESS</p>

While you have the right to select any Designated Manager, we retain the right to accept or reject any proposed individual or entity as the Designated Manager. You will be responsible for the compensation to any individual or entity you contract to act as the Designated Manager of the Business. You have the sole legal responsibility for any dispute relating to such individual or entity. We maintain the right to require any approved Designated Manager to attend and satisfactorily complete our initial training program before opening the Business. You must keep us informed at all times of the identity of your Designated Manager. If you must replace the Designated Manager, your replacement Manager must be approved by us within 60 days, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld &ndash; we may additionally require such replacement Designated Manager to attend and complete our training program at your expense. If the Franchisee is an entity, its Designated Manager is not required to own an equity interest in the Franchisee.</p>

<p>Periodically, we may allow certain services or products that are not otherwise authorized for general use as a part of the System to be offered locally or regionally based on factors, including test marketing, your qualifications, and regional or local differences.</p>

<p>13. STANDARDS OF OPERATION</p>

Accordingly, Franchisee shall provide or offer for sale or use at the Franchised Business only those services, with the greatest diligence and care by Franchisee, that Franchisor approves (and which are not thereafter disapproved) and that comply with Franchisor&rsquo;s specifications and quality standards. If required by Franchisor, any such items or services shall be purchased only from Franchisor. Franchisor shall maintain inventory levels for all supplies offered solely by Franchisor at a level sufficient to ensure prompt delivery to all Franchisees.

<p> 13.1.2 Notwithstanding anything contrary in this Agreement, Franchisor has the right to review from time to time its approval of any items or suppliers. Franchisor may revoke its approval of any item, service or supplier at any time by notifying Franchisee and/or the supplier. Franchisee shall, at its own expense, promptly cease using, selling or providing any items or services disapproved by Franchisor.

Franchisor has the right to give its consent to one (1) or more franchisees to provide certain products or services not authorized for general use as part of the System. Such consent will be based upon the factors in Section 10.4 and shall not create any rights in Franchisee to provide the same products or services.</p>

If Franchisor or an Affiliate is an Approved Supplier, Franchisee shall execute a standard form purchase or supply agreement for the items to be supplied by Franchisor or its Affiliate. If Franchisee desires to utilize any products, services or new technology that Franchisor has not approved (for products and services that require supplier approval), Franchisee shall first send Franchisor sufficient information, specifications and samples for Franchisor to determine whether the service or product complies with its standards and specifications or whether the supplier meets its Approved Supplier criteria.

Franchisor will decide within a reasonable time (usually thirty [30] days) after receiving the required information whether Franchisee may purchase or lease such items or services or from such supplier. Approval of a supplier may be conditioned on the supplier&rsquo;s ability to provide sufficient quantity of product; quality of products or services at competitive prices; production and delivery capability; and dependability and general reputation.

<p>13.8 Compliance with Good Business Practices</p>

<p> Franchisee acknowledges that the quality of customer service, and every detail of appearance and demeanor of Franchisee and its employees, is material to this Agreement and the relationship created and licenses granted hereby.

<p> Franchisor shall be available to render advice, discuss problems, and offer general guidance to Franchisee by telephone and/or electronic correspondence, with respect to planning and operating the Franchised Business. Franchisor shall not charge for this service. Franchisor&rsquo;s advice or guidance to Franchisee relative to prices for products and services that, in Franchisor&rsquo;s judgment, constitutes good business practice is based upon the experience of Franchisor and its franchisees in operating Our Maids businesses and an analysis of costs and prices charged for competitive products and services. Within range, Franchisee shall have the right to change/determine the price to be charged for a particular service by the Franchised Business at the time of sale (if necessary). Notwithstanding, Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that Franchisor shall not be held liable for such advice; any decisions made by Franchisee, whether on its own accord or through suggestion from Franchisor is Franchisee's sole and absolute responsibility.</p>

<p>take such action as may be necessary to cancel or assign to Franchisor, at Franchisor&rsquo;s option, any assumed name or equivalent registration filed with state, city, or county authorities which contains the name &ldquo;Our Maids&rdquo; or any other Mark, and Franchisee shall furnish Franchisor with evidence satisfactory to Franchisor of compliance with this obligation within thirty (30) days after termination or expiration of this Agreement;</p>

<p>pay all sums owing to Franchisor and any Affiliate. In the event of termination for any default of Franchisee, such sums shall include, but not be limited to, all damages, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees, with respect to litigation, arbitration, appellate, or bankruptcy proceedings, unpaid Royalty Fees, loss of future Royalty Fee payments incurred by Franchisor as a result of any early termination of this Agreement, and any other amounts due to Franchisor or any Affiliate;</p>

<p>pay to Franchisor all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees, incurred by Franchisor subsequent to the termination or expiration of the Franchise in obtaining injunctive or other relief for the enforcement of any provisions of this Agreement;</p>

<p>immediately return to Franchisor the Operations Manual, Trade Secrets, and all other Confidential Information, including records, files, instructions, brochures, agreements, disclosure statements, and any and all other materials provided by Franchisor to Franchisee relating to the operation of the Franchised Business (all of which are acknowledged to be Franchisor&rsquo;s property);</p>

<p>assign all telephone listings and numbers for the Franchised Business to Franchisor and shall notify the telephone company and all listing agencies of the termination or expiration of Franchisee&rsquo;s right to use any telephone numbers or facsimile numbers associated with the Marks in any regular, classified or other telephone directory listing and shall authorize transfer of same to or at the direction of Franchisor; and</p>

<p>comply with all other applicable provisions of this Agreement.</p>

<p>17.2 Post-Termination Covenant Not to Compete</p>

<p> 17.2.1 Franchisee acknowledges that the restrictive covenants contained in this Section and in Section 17 are fair and reasonable.</p>

<p> 17.2.2 Except as otherwise approved in writing by Franchisor, neither Franchisee, nor any holder of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisee, nor any officer, director, executive, manager or member of the professional staff of Franchisee, shall, for a period of two (2) years after the expiration or termination of this Agreement, regardless of the cause of termination, either directly or indirectly: offer Competitive Business services located or operating (a) at or within a twenty-five (25) mile radius of the Franchised Business, or (b) within a twenty-five (25) mile radius of any other Our Maids Business in existence at the time of termination or expiration, or (c) any other business owned or operated by the Franchisor in existence at the time of termination or expansion;</p>

<p>solicit or otherwise attempt to induce or influence any customer or other business associate of Franchisor to terminate or modify his, her or its business relationship with Franchisor or to compete against Franchisor; or</p>

<p>In furtherance of this Section, Franchisor has the right to require certain individuals to execute standard form nondisclosure or non-competition agreements in a form the same as or similar to the Nondisclosure and Non-Competition Agreement attached as Schedule 2.</p>

<p>17.3 Unfair Competition</p>

<p> If Franchisee operates any other business, Franchisee shall not use any reproduction, counterfeit, copy or colorable imitation of the Marks, either in connection with such other business or the promotion thereof, that is likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception, or that is likely to dilute Franchisor&rsquo;s rights in the Marks. Franchisee shall not utilize any designation of origin, description or representation that falsely suggests or represents an association or connection with Franchisor. This Section is not intended as an approval of Franchisee&rsquo;s right to operate other businesses and in no way is it intended to contradict Sections 17, 17.1 or 17.2. Franchisee shall make such modifications or alterations to the Franchised Business (including changing telephone and facsimile numbers) immediately upon termination or expiration of this Agreement as may be necessary to prevent any association between Franchisor or the System and any business subsequently operated by Franchisee or others at the Franchised Business. Franchisee shall make such specific additional changes to the Franchised Business as Franchisor may reasonably request for that purpose including, without limitation, removal of all physical and structural features identifying or distinctive to the System. If Franchisee fails or refuses to comply with the requirements of this Section, Franchisor has the right to enter upon the Franchised Business for the purpose of making or causing to be made such changes as may be required, at the expense of Franchisee, which expense Franchisee shall pay upon demand.</p>

<p>17.4 Franchisor&rsquo;s Option to Purchase Certain Business Assets</p>

<p> Franchisor has the right (but not the obligation), for a period of thirty (30) days after termination or expiration of this Agreement, to purchase any or all assets of the Franchised Business including improvements, vehicles, service tools and equipment, supplies and other inventory or equipment. The purchase price shall be equal to the assets&rsquo; book value. If Franchisor elects to exercise this option to purchase, it has the right to set off all amounts due from Franchisee under this Agreement, if any, against the purchase price.</p>

<p>17.5 Survival of Certain Provisions</p>

<p> All obligations of Franchisor and Franchisee, which expressly or by their nature survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement, shall continue in full force and effect subsequent to and notwithstanding their expiration or termination and until satisfied or by their nature expire.</p>

<p>18. TRANSFERABILITY OF INTEREST</p>

<p>18.1 Transfer by Franchisor</p>

<p> This Agreement and all rights and duties hereunder are fully transferable in whole or in part by Franchisor and such rights will inure to the benefit of any person or entity to whom transferred; provided, however, that with respect to any assignment resulting in the subsequent performance by the assignee of the functions of Franchisor, the assignee shall assume the obligations of Franchisor hereunder and Franchisor shall thereafter have no liability for the performance of any obligations contained in this Agreement.</p>

<p>18.2 Transfer by Franchisee to a Third Party</p>

<p> The rights and duties of Franchisee as in this Agreement, and the Franchise herein granted, are personal to Franchisee (or its owners), and Franchisor has entered into this Agreement in reliance upon Franchisee&rsquo;s personal or collective skill and financial ability. Accordingly, neither Franchisee nor any holder of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisee may sell, assign, convey, give away, pledge, mortgage, sublicense or otherwise transfer, whether by operation of law or otherwise, any interest in this Agreement, the Franchise granted hereby, the assets of the Franchised Business or any part or all of the ownership interest in Franchisee without the prior written approval of Franchisor. Any purported transfer without such approval shall be null and void and shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement. If Franchisee is in compliance with this Agreement, Franchisor&rsquo;s consent to such transfer shall be conditioned upon the satisfaction of the following requirements:</p>

<p>Franchisee has complied with the requirements in Section 19;</p>

<p>all obligations owed to Franchisor, and all other outstanding obligations relating to the Franchised Business, are fully paid and satisfied;</p>

<p>Franchisee (and any transferring owners, if Franchisee is a business entity) has executed a general release, in a form the same as or similar to the General Release attached as Schedule 1, of any and all claims against Franchisor, including its officers, directors, shareholders, managers, members, partners, owners, employees and agents (in their corporate and individual capacities), including, without limitation, claims arising under federal, state or local laws, rules or ordinances, and any other matters incident to the termination of this Agreement or to the transfer of Franchisee&rsquo;s interest herein or to the transfer of Franchisee&rsquo;s ownership of all or any part of the Franchise; provided, however, that if a general release is prohibited, Franchisee shall give the maximum release allowed by law;</p>

<p>the prospective transferee has satisfied Franchisor that it meets Franchisor&rsquo;s management, business and financial standards, and otherwise possesses the character and capabilities, including business reputation and credit rating, as Franchisor may require to demonstrate ability to conduct the Franchised Business;</p>

<p>the transferee and, if Franchisor requires, all persons owning any interest in the transferee, have executed the then-current franchise agreement for new franchisees, which may be substantially different from this Agreement, including different Royalty Fee and other material provisions, and the franchise agreement then executed shall be for the term specified in such agreement;</p>

<p>the transferee has executed a general release, in a form the same as or similar to the General Release attached as Schedule 1, of any and all claims against Franchisor and its officers, directors, shareholders, managers, members, partners, owners, employees and agents (in their corporate and individual capacities), with respect to any representations regarding the Franchise or the business conducted pursuant thereto or any other matter that may have been made to the transferee by Franchisee;</p>

<p>Franchisee has provided Franchisor with a complete copy of all contracts and agreements and related documentation between Franchisee and the prospective transferee relating to the intended sale or transfer of the Franchise;</p>

<p>Franchisee, or the transferee, has paid to Franchisor, before the transaction is completed, a transfer fee in the amount of 25% of the then current initial franchise fee;</p>

<p>the transferee, or all holders of a legal or beneficial interest in the transferee, has agreed to be personally bound jointly and severally by all provisions of this Agreement for the remainder of its term by executing a personal guaranty in such form as prepared by Franchisor;</p>

<p>the transferee has obtained all necessary consents and approvals by third parties and all applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules, ordinances, and requirements applicable to the transfer have been complied with or satisfied;</p>

<p>Franchisee has, and if Franchisee is an entity, all of the holders of a legal and beneficial interest in Franchisee have executed and delivered to Franchisor a nondisclosure and non-competition agreement in a form satisfactory to Franchisor and in substance the same as the nondisclosure and non-competition covenants contained in Sections 7 and 17; and</p>

<p>the transferee agrees that it shall complete, to Franchisor&rsquo;s satisfaction, a training program in substance similar to the initial training described in Section 8.1 prior to assuming the management of the day-to-day operation of the Franchised Business.</p>

<p>18.3 Transfer to a Controlled Entity</p>

<p> 18.3.1 If Franchisee wishes to transfer this Agreement or any interest herein to a corporation, limited liability company or other legal entity which shall be entirely owned by Franchisee (&ldquo;Controlled Entity&rdquo;), which Controlled Entity is being formed for the financial planning, tax or other convenience of Franchisee, Franchisor&rsquo;s consent to such transfer shall be conditioned upon the satisfaction of the following requirements:</p>

<p>the Controlled Entity is newly organized and its charter or articles of formation provides that its activities are confined exclusively to the operation of the Franchised Business;</p>

<p>Franchisee or all holders of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisee own all of the equity and voting power of the outstanding stock or other capital interest in the Controlled Entity;</p>

<p>all obligations of Franchisee to Franchisor or any Affiliate are fully paid and satisfied; provided, however, that neither Franchisee nor the Controlled Entity shall be required to pay a transfer fee as required according to Section 18.2(h);</p>

<p>the Controlled Entity has entered into a written agreement with Franchisor expressly assuming the obligations of this Agreement and all other agreements relating to the operation of the Franchised Business. If the consent of any other party to any such other agreement is required, Franchisee has obtained such written consent and provided the same to Franchisor prior to consent by Franchisor;</p>

<p>all holders of a legal or beneficial interest in the Controlled Entity have entered into an agreement with Franchisor jointly and severally guaranteeing the full payment of the Controlled Entity&rsquo;s obligations to Franchisor and the performance by the Controlled Entity of all the obligations of this Agreement;</p>

<p>each stock certificate or other ownership interest certificate of the Controlled Entity has conspicuously endorsed upon the face thereof a statement in a form satisfactory to Franchisor that it is held subject to, and that further assignment or transfer thereof is subject to, all restrictions imposed upon transfers and assignments by this Agreement; and</p>

<p>copies of the Controlled Entity&rsquo;s articles of incorporation or organization, bylaws, operating agreement, federal tax identification number, and other governing regulations or documents, including resolutions of the board of directors authorizing entry into this Agreement, have been promptly furnished to Franchisor. Any amendment to any such documents shall also be furnished to Franchisor immediately upon adoption.</p>

<p> 18.3.2 The term of the transferred franchise shall be the unexpired term of this Agreement, including all renewal rights, subject to any and all conditions applicable to such renewal rights.</p>

<p> 18.3.3 Franchisor&rsquo;s consent to a transfer of any interest in this Agreement, or of any ownership interest in the Franchised Business, shall not constitute a waiver of any claims Franchisor may have against the transferor or the transferee, nor shall it be deemed a waiver of Franchisor&rsquo;s right to demand compliance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>

<p>18.4 Franchisor&rsquo;s Disclosure to Transferee</p>

<p> Franchisor has the right, without liability of any kind or nature whatsoever to Franchisee, to make available for inspection by any intended transferee of Franchisee all or any part of Franchisor&rsquo;s records relating to this Agreement, the Franchised Business or to the history of the relationship of the parties hereto. Franchisee hereby specifically consents to such disclosure by Franchisor and shall release and hold Franchisor harmless from and against any claim, loss or injury resulting from an inspection of Franchisor&rsquo;s records relating to the Franchised Business by an intended transferee identified by Franchisee.</p>

<p>18.5 For-Sale Advertising</p>

<p> Franchisee shall NOT, without prior written consent of Franchisor, place in, on or upon the area of the Franchised Business, or in any communication media, any form of advertising relating to the sale of the Franchised Business or the rights granted hereunder.</p>

<p>18.6 Transfer by Death or Incapacity</p>

<p> Upon the death or Incapacity of Franchisee (if Franchisee is an individual) or any holder of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisee (if Franchisee is a business entity), the appropriate representative of such person (whether administrator, personal representative or trustee) shall, within a reasonable time not exceeding one hundred eighty (180) days following such event, transfer such individual&rsquo;s interest in the Franchised Business or in Franchisee to a third party approved by Franchisor. Such transfers, including transfers by will or inheritance, shall be subject to the conditions for assignments and transfers contained in this Agreement. During such one hundred eighty (180) day period, the Franchised Business must remain at all times under the primary management of a Designated Manager who otherwise meets Franchisor&rsquo;s management qualifications.</p>

<p> Following such a death or Incapacity of such person as described in this Section 18.6, if necessary in Franchisor&rsquo;s discretion, Franchisor shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assume operation of the Franchised Business until the deceased or incapacitated owner&rsquo;s interest is transferred to a third party approved by Franchisor. Franchisor shall be given access to the Franchised Business, even if located within Franchisee&rsquo;s or its Designated Manager&rsquo;s principal residence, and shall not be held liable for trespass or any related tort. Franchisor may charge a management fee as stated in the Operations Manual from time to time, currently equal to $250 per person per day, and Franchisor shall be entitled to reimbursement of any expenses Franchisor incurs that are not paid out of the operating cash flow of the Franchised Business.</p>

<p>19. RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL</p>

<p>19.1 Submission of Offer</p>

<p> If Franchisee, or any of its owners, proposes to sell or otherwise transfer (including a transfer by death or Incapacity according to Section 18.6) the Franchised Business (or any of its assets outside of the normal course of business), any ownership interest in Franchisee or any ownership interest in the Franchise granted hereunder, Franchisee shall obtain and deliver a bona fide, executed written offer or proposal to purchase, along with all pertinent documents including any contract or due diligence materials, to Franchisor, except with regards to a sale or transfer to a family member. The offer must apply only to an approved sale of the assets or interests listed above and may not include any other property or rights of Franchisee or any of its owners.</p>

<p>19.2 Franchisor&rsquo;s Right to Purchase</p>

<p> Franchisor shall, for thirty (30) days from the date of delivery of all such documents, have the right, exercisable by written notice to Franchisee, to purchase the offered assets or interest for the price and on the same terms and conditions contained in such offer communicated to Franchisee. Franchisor has the right to substitute cash for the fair market value of any form of payment proposed in such offer. Franchisor&rsquo;s credit shall be deemed at least equal to the credit of any proposed buyer. After providing notice to Franchisee of Franchisor&rsquo;s intent to exercise this right of first refusal, Franchisor shall have up to sixty (60) days to close the purchase. Franchisor shall be entitled to receive from Franchisee all customary representations and warranties given by Franchisee as the seller of the assets or such ownership interest or, at Franchisor&rsquo;s election, such representations and warranties contained in the proposal.</p>

<p>19.3 Non-Exercise of Right of First Refusal</p>

<p> If Franchisor does not exercise its right of first refusal within thirty (30) days from the date of delivery of all such documents, the offer or proposal may be accepted by Franchisee or any of its owners, subject to Franchisor&rsquo;s prior written approval as required by Section 18.2. Should the sale fail to close within 120 days after the offer is delivered to Franchisor, Franchisor&rsquo;s right of first refusal shall renew and be implemented in accordance with this Section.</p>

<p>19.4 Sales or Transfers to Family Excepted</p>

<p> If Franchisee proposes to sell or otherwise transfer the Franchised Business (or any of its assets outside of the normal course of business), any ownership interest in Franchisee or any ownership interest in the Franchise granted hereunder to a member of Franchisee&rsquo;s (or its owners&rsquo;) family, then the terms and conditions of this Section shall be inapplicable. Nothing in this Section 19.4 shall be construed to relieve Franchisee from full compliance with the terms and conditions of Section 18.2 prior to a sale or transfer to family according to this Section.</p>

<p>20. BENEFICIAL OWNERS OF FRANCHISEE</p>

<p> Franchisee represents, and Franchisor enters into this Agreement in reliance upon such representation, that the individual(s) identified in Schedule 6 is/are the sole holder(s) of a legal or beneficial interest (in the stated percentages) of Franchisee.</p>

<p>21. RELATIONSHIP AND INDEMNIFICATION</p>

<p>21.1 Relationship</p>

<p> This Agreement is purely a contractual relationship between the parties and does not appoint or make Franchisee an agent, legal representative, joint-venturer, partner, employee, servant, or independent contractor of Franchisor for any purpose whatsoever. Franchisee may not represent or imply to third parties that Franchisee is an agent of Franchisor, and Franchisee is in no way authorized to make any contract, agreement, warranty, or representation on behalf of Franchisor, or to create any obligation, express or implied, on Franchisor&rsquo;s behalf. During the term of this Agreement, and any extension or renewal hereof, Franchisee shall hold itself out to the public only as a franchisee and an owner of the Franchised Business operating the Franchised Business according to a franchise from Franchisor. Franchisee shall take such affirmative action as may be necessary to do so including, without limitation, exhibiting a notice of that fact in a conspicuous place on all forms, stationery or other written materials, the content of which Franchisor has the right to specify. Under no circumstances shall Franchisor be liable for any act, omission, contract, debt, nor any other obligation of Franchisee. Franchisor shall in no way be responsible for any injuries to persons or property resulting from the operation of the Franchised Business by Franchisee. Any third-party contractors and vendors retained by Franchisee to convert or construct the premises are independent contractors of Franchisee alone.</p>

<p>21.2 Standard of Care</p>

<p> This Agreement does not establish a fiduciary relationship between the parties.</p>

<p>21.3 Indemnification</p>

<p> Franchisee shall hold harmless and indemnify Franchisor, any Affiliate, all holders of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisor and all officers, directors, executives, managers, members, partners, owners, employees, agents, successors and assigns (collectively &ldquo;Franchisor Indemnities&rdquo;) from and against all losses, damages, fines, costs, expenses or liability (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and all other costs of litigation) incurred in connection with any action, suit, demand, claim, investigation or proceeding, or any settlement thereof, which arises from or is based upon Franchisee&rsquo;s (a) ownership or operation of the Franchised Business; (b) violation, breach or asserted violation or breach of any federal, state or local law, regulation or rule; (c) breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or provision of this Agreement or any other agreement between Franchisee and Franchisor (or an Affiliate); (d) defamation of Franchisor or the System; (e) acts, errors or omissions committed or incurred in connection with the Franchised Business; or (f) infringement, violation or alleged infringement or violation of any Mark, patent or copyright or any misuse of the Trade Secrets or other Confidential Information. The obligations of this Section 21.3 shall expressly survive the termination of this Agreement.</p>

<p>21.4 Right to Retain Counsel</p>

<p> Franchisee shall give Franchisor immediate notice of any such action, suit, demand, claim, investigation, or proceeding that may give rise to a claim for indemnification by a Franchisor Indemnity. Franchisor has the right to retain counsel of its own choosing in connection with any such action, suit, demand, claim, investigation or proceeding. In order to protect persons, property, Franchisor&rsquo;s reputation or the goodwill of others, Franchisor has the right to, at any time without notice, take such remedial or corrective actions as it deems expedient with respect to any action, suit, demand, claim, investigation or proceeding if, in Franchisor&rsquo;s sole judgment, there are grounds to believe any of the acts or circumstances listed above have occurred. If Franchisor&rsquo;s exercise of its rights under this Section causes any of Franchisee&rsquo;s insurers to refuse to pay a third-party claim, all cause of action and legal remedies Franchisee might have against such insurer shall automatically be assigned to Franchisor without the need for any further action on either party&rsquo;s part. Under no circumstances shall Franchisor be required or obligated to seek coverage from third parties or otherwise mitigate losses in order to maintain a claim against Franchisee. The failure to pursue such remedy or mitigate such loss shall in no way reduce the amounts recoverable by Franchisor from Franchisee. Franchisee agrees to not be a party to class action suit against the Franchisor or any of its Affiliates under any circumstances.</p>

<p>22. GENERAL CONDITIONS AND PROVISIONS</p>

<p>22.1 No Waiver</p>

<p> No failure of Franchisor to exercise any power reserved to it hereunder, or to insist upon strict compliance by Franchisee with any obligation or condition hereunder, and no custom nor practice of the parties in variance with the terms hereof, shall constitute a waiver of Franchisor&rsquo;s right to demand exact compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Waiver by Franchisor of any particular default by Franchisee shall not be binding unless in writing and executed by Franchisor and shall not affect nor impair Franchisor&rsquo;s right with respect to any subsequent default of the same or of a different nature. Subsequent acceptance by Franchisor of any payment(s) due shall not be deemed to be a waiver by Franchisor of any preceding breach by Franchisee of any terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement.</p>

<p>22.2 Injunctive Relief</p>

<p> As any breach by Franchisee of any of the restrictions contained in Sections 6, 7, and 17 would result in irreparable injury to Franchisor, and as the damages arising out of any such breach would be difficult to ascertain, in addition to all other remedies provided by law or in equity, Franchisor shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief (whether a restraining order, a preliminary injunction or a permanent injunction) against any such breach, whether actual or contemplated, without the necessity of posting security or bond and Franchisee shall be responsible for Franchisor&rsquo;s reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees incurred in pursuing the same. Franchisor&rsquo;s right to seek injunctive relief will not affect the parties&rsquo; waiver of jury trial and covenant to arbitrate all disputes in accordance with Section 23.7. Franchisor&rsquo;s rights herein shall include pursuing injunctive relief through arbitration or in a state or federal court.</p>

<p>22.3 Notices</p>

<p> All notices required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed received: (a) at the time delivered by hand to the recipient party (or to an officer, director or partner of the recipient party); (b) on the next business day after transmission by facsimile or other reasonably reliable electronic communication system; (c) two (2) business days after being sent via guaranteed overnight delivery by a commercial courier service; or (d) five (5) business days after being sent by Registered Mail, return receipt requested. Either party may change its address by a written notice sent in accordance with this Section 22.3. All notices, payments and reports required by this Agreement shall be sent to Franchisor at the following address, or at such other address as Franchisor may provide:</p>

<p> Our Maids Franchise, Inc.  Attn.: Antonio Moreno  8 The Green, Suite 14095  Dover, DE 19901</p>

<p>22.4 Cost of Enforcement or Defense</p>

<p> If Franchisor is required to enforce this Agreement in a judicial or arbitration proceeding, if it is the prevailing party, it shall be entitled to reimbursement of its costs, including reasonable accounting and attorneys&rsquo; fees, in connection with such proceeding.</p>

<p>22.5 Unlimited Guaranty and Assumption of Obligations</p>

<p> All holders of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisee of five percent (5%) or greater shall be required to execute, as of the date of this Agreement, the Unlimited Guaranty and Assumption of Obligations attached as Schedule 3, through which such holders agree to assume and discharge all of Franchisee&rsquo;s obligations under this Agreement and to be personally liable hereunder for all of the same.</p>

<p>22.6 Approvals</p>

<p> Whenever this Agreement requires the prior approval or consent of Franchisor, Franchisee shall make a timely written request to Franchisor for such approval and, except as otherwise provided herein, any approval or consent granted shall be effective only if in writing. Franchisor makes no warranties or guarantees upon which Franchisee may rely, and assumes no liability or obligation to Franchisee or any third party to which it would not otherwise be subject, by providing any waiver, approval, advice, consent or services to Franchisee in connection with this Agreement, or by reason of any neglect, delay or denial of any request for approval.</p>

<p>22.7 Entire Agreement</p>

<p> This Agreement and all exhibits to this Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties and supersede any and all prior negotiations, understandings, representations, and agreements. Nothing in this or in any related agreement, however, is intended to disclaim the representations we made in the franchise disclosure document that we furnished to you. No amendment, change or variance from this Agreement shall be binding on either party unless executed in writing by both parties.</p>

<p>22.8 Severability and Modification</p>

<p> Except as noted below, each paragraph, part, term and provision of this Agreement shall be considered severable. If any paragraph, part, term or provision herein is ruled to be unenforceable, unreasonable or invalid, such ruling shall not impair the operation of or affect the remaining portions, paragraphs, parts, terms and provisions of this Agreement, and the latter shall continue to be given full force and effect and bind the parties; and such unenforceable, unreasonable or invalid paragraphs, parts, terms or provisions shall be deemed not part of this Agreement.</p>

<p> Notwithstanding the above, each of the covenants contained in Sections 7 and 17 shall be construed as independent of any other covenant or provision of this Agreement. If all or any portion of any such covenant is held to be unenforceable, unreasonable, or invalid, then it shall be amended to provide for limitations on disclosure of Trade Secrets or other Confidential Information or on competition to the maximum extent provided or permitted by law.</p>

<p>22.9 Construction</p>

<p> All captions herein are intended solely for the convenience of the parties, and none shall be deemed to affect the meaning or construction of any provision hereof.</p>

<p>22.10 Force Majeure</p>

<p> Whenever a period of time is provided in this Agreement for either party to perform any act, except pay monies, neither party shall be liable nor responsible for any delays due to strikes, lockouts, casualties, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental regulation or control or other causes beyond the reasonable control of the parties, and the time period for the performance of such act shall be extended for the amount of time of the delay. This clause shall not result in an extension of the term of this Agreement.</p>

<p>22.11 Timing</p>

<p> Time is of the essence. Except as in Section 22.10, failure to perform any act within the time required or permitted by this Agreement shall be a material breach.</p>

<p>22.12 Withholding Payments</p>

<p> Franchisee shall not, for any reason, withhold payment of any Royalty Fees or other amounts due to Franchisor or to an Affiliate. Franchisee shall not withhold or offset any amounts, damages or other monies allegedly due to Franchisee against any amounts due to Franchisor. No endorsement or statement on any payment for less than the full amount due to Franchisor will be construed as an acknowledgment of payment in full, or an accord and satisfaction, and Franchisor has the right to accept and cash any such payment without prejudice to Franchisor&rsquo;s right to recover the full amount due, or pursue any other remedy provided in this Agreement or by law. Franchisor has the right to apply any payments made by Franchisee against any of Franchisee&rsquo;s past due indebtedness as Franchisor deems appropriate. Franchisor shall set off sums Franchisor owes to Franchisee against any unpaid debts owed by Franchisee to Franchisor.</p>

<p>22.13 Further Assurances</p>

<p> Each party to this Agreement will execute and deliver such further instruments, contracts, forms or other documents, and will perform such further acts, as may be necessary or desirable to perform or complete any term, covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement.</p>

<p>22.14 Third Party Beneficiaries</p>

<p> Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, nothing in this Agreement is intended, nor shall be deemed, to confer upon any person or legal entity other than Franchisor or Franchisee, and their respective successors and assigns as may be contemplated by this Agreement, any rights or remedies under this Agreement.</p>

<p>22.15 Multiple Originals</p>

<p> Both parties will execute multiple copies of this Agreement, and each executed copy will be deemed an original.</p>

<p>23. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</p>

<p>23.1 Choice of Law</p>

<p> Except as to claims governed by federal law, Delaware law governs all claims that in any way relate to or arise out of this Agreement or any of the dealings of the parties (&ldquo;Claims&rdquo;). However, no laws regulating the sale of franchises or governing the relationship between franchisor and franchisee shall apply unless the jurisdictional requirements of such laws are met independently of this paragraph.</p>

<p>23.2 Jurisdiction and Venue</p>

<p> You and we agree that venue and jurisdiction for any Claims, except those required to be submitted to arbitration, shall be proper solely in the state and federal court nearest to our corporate headquarters, presently located in Dover, Delaware. However, if you are an Illinois, Maryland, or Washington State resident or your franchise territory is located in Illinois, Maryland, or Washington State, you agree to bring any Claims, if at all, solely in arbitration before the American Arbitration Association in the city or county where our corporate headquarters are located.</p>

<p>23.3 Jury Waiver</p>

<p> In any trial between any of the parties as to any Claims, you and we agree to waive our rights to a jury trial and instead have such action tried by a judge.</p>

<p>23.4 Class Action Waiver</p>

<p> Title:   __ SCHEDULE 2 TO THE FRANCHISE AGREEMENT NONDISCLOSURE AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT</p>

<p> This &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo; made as of the  _ day of     _, 20 _, is by and between      , (&ldquo;Franchisee,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us,&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) and        (&ldquo;Individual,&rdquo; &ldquo;you,&rdquo; or &ldquo;your&rdquo;).</p>

<p>W I T N E S S E T H:</p>

<p> WHEREAS, Franchisee is a party to that certain Franchise Agreement dated      , 20__ (&ldquo;Franchise Agreement&rdquo;) by and between Franchisee and the Franchisor, Our Maids Franchise, Inc. (&ldquo;Company&rdquo;); and</p>

<p> WHEREAS, Franchisee desires Individual to have access to and review certain Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information, which are more particularly described below; and</p>

<p> WHEREAS, Franchisee is required by the Franchise Agreement to have Individual execute this Agreement prior to providing Individual access to said Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information; and   WHEREAS, Individual understands the necessity of not disclosing any such information to any other party or using such information to compete against Company, Franchisee or any other franchisee of Company in any business (i) that offers or provides (or grants franchises or licenses to others to operate a business that offers or provides) products and services the same as or similar to those provided by Franchisee or (ii) in which Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information (as defined below) could be used to the disadvantage of Franchisee, or Company, any affiliate of Company or Company&rsquo;s other franchisees (hereinafter, &ldquo;Competitive Business&rdquo;); provided, however, that the term &ldquo;Competitive Business&rdquo; shall not apply to any business operated by Franchisee under a Franchise Agreement with Company.</p>

<p> NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and undertakings stated here, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereby mutually agree as follows:</p>

<p> 1. Trade Secrets and Confidential Information</p>

<p> Individual understands Franchisee possesses and will possess Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information that are important to its business.</p>

<p> a) For the purposes of this Agreement, a &ldquo;Trade Secret&rdquo; is information in any form (including, but not limited to, materials and techniques, technical or non-technical data, formulas, patterns, recipes compilations, programs, devices, methods, techniques, drawings, processes, financial data, financial plans, product plans, passwords, lists of actual or potential customers or suppliers) related to or used in the Our Maids Business that is not commonly known by or available to the public and that information: (i) derives economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (ii) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.</p>

<p> b) For the purposes of this Agreement &ldquo;Confidential Information&rdquo; means technical and non-technical information used in or related to Our Maids that is not commonly known by or available to the public, including, without limitation, Trade Secrets and information contained in the Operations Manual and training guides and materials. In addition, any other information identified as confidential when delivered by Franchisee shall be deemed Confidential Information. Confidential Information shall not include, however, any information that: (i) is now or subsequently becomes generally available to the public through no fault of Individual; (ii) Individual can demonstrate was rightfully in its possession, without obligation of nondisclosure, prior to disclosure according to this Agreement; (iii) is independently developed without the use of any Confidential Information; or (iv) is rightfully obtained from a third party who has the right, without obligation of nondisclosure, to transfer or disclose such information.</p>

<p> c) Any information expressly designated by Company or Franchisee as &ldquo;Trade Secrets&rdquo; or &ldquo;Confidential Information&rdquo; shall be deemed such for all purposes of this Agreement, but the absence of designation shall not relieve Individual of his or her obligations hereunder in respect of information otherwise constituting Trade Secrets or Confidential Information. Individual understands Franchisee&rsquo;s providing of access to the Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information creates a relationship of confidence and trust between Individual and Franchisee with respect to the Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information.</p>

<p> 2. Confidentiality/Non-Disclosure</p>

<p> a) Individual shall not communicate or divulge to (or use for the benefit of) any other person, firm, association, or corporation, with the sole exception of Franchisee, now or at any time in the future, any Trade Secrets or other Confidential Information. At all times from the date of this Agreement, Individual must take all steps reasonably necessary and/or requested by Franchisee to ensure that the Confidential Information and Trade Secrets are kept confidential according to the terms of this Agreement. Individual must comply with all applicable policies, procedures and practices that Franchisee has established and may establish from time to time with regard to the Confidential Information and Trade Secrets.</p>

<p> b) Individual&rsquo;s obligations under paragraph 2(a) of this Agreement shall continue in effect after termination of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee, regardless of the reason or reasons for termination, and whether such termination is voluntary or involuntary, and Franchisee is entitled to communicate Individual&rsquo;s obligations under this Agreement to any future customer or employer to the extent deemed necessary by Franchisee for protection of its rights hereunder and regardless of whether Individual or any of its affiliates or assigns becomes an investor, partner, joint venturer, broker, distributor or the like in an Our Maids Business.</p>

<p> 3. Non-Competition</p>

<p> a) During the term of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee and for a period of two (2) years after the expiration or termination of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee, regardless of the cause of expiration or termination, Individual shall not, directly or indirectly, divert or attempt to divert any business or customer of Franchisee or the Company to any Competitive Business, by direct or indirect inducement or otherwise, or do or perform, directly or indirectly, any other act injurious or prejudicial to the goodwill associated with the Company&rsquo;s service mark &ldquo;Our Maids&rdquo; and such other trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, designs, graphics, logos, emblems, insignia, fascia, slogans, drawings and other commercial symbols as the Company designates to be used in connection with Our Maids or the Company&rsquo;s uniform standards, methods, procedures and specifications for the establishment and operation of an Our Maids business.     b) During the term of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, regardless of the cause of termination, Individual shall not, directly or indirectly, offer Competitive Business services anywhere within a TWENTY FIVE (25) mile radius of any Our Maids location without the express written consent of Franchisee and the Company.</p>

<p> c) During the term of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, regardless of the cause of termination, Individual shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit or otherwise attempt to induce or influence any business associate of Franchisee, Company or any other Our Maids Business to compete against, or terminate or modify his, her or its business relationship with, Franchisee, Company or any other Our Maids Business.</p>

<p> 4. Reasonableness of Restrictions</p>

<p> Individual acknowledges that each of the terms stated here, including the restrictive covenants, is fair and reasonable and is reasonably required for the protection of Franchisee, Company, and Company&rsquo;s Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information, the Company&rsquo;s business system, network of franchises and trade and service marks, and Individual waives any right to challenge these restrictions as being overly broad, unreasonable or otherwise unenforceable. If, however, a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any such restriction is unreasonable or unenforceable, then Individual shall submit to the reduction of any such activity, time period or geographic restriction necessary to enable the court to enforce such restrictions to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. It is the desire and intent of the parties that the provisions of this Agreement shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies applied in any jurisdiction where enforcement is sought.</p>

<p> 5. Relief for Breaches of Confidentiality, Non-Solicitation, and Non-Competition</p>

<p> Individual further acknowledges that an actual or threatened violation of the covenants contained in this Agreement will cause Franchisee and Company immediate and irreparable harm, damage and injury that cannot be fully compensated for by an award of damages or other remedies at law. Accordingly, Franchisee and/or Company shall be entitled, as a matter of right, to an injunction from any court of competent jurisdiction restraining any further violation by Individual of this Agreement without any requirement to show any actual damage or to post any bond or other security. Such right to an injunction shall be cumulative and in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights and remedies that Franchisee and Company may have at law or in equity.</p>

<p> 6. Dispute Resolution</p>

<p> a) Choice of Law. Except as to claims governed by federal law, the local law where the Franchised Business is located governs all claims that in any way relate to or arise out of this Agreement or any of the dealings of the parties (&ldquo;Claims&rdquo;). However, no laws regulating the sale of franchises or governing the relationship between franchisor and franchisee shall apply unless the jurisdictional requirements of such laws are met independently of this paragraph.</p>

<p> b) Jurisdiction and Venue. You and we agree that venue and jurisdiction for any Claims, except those required to be submitted to arbitration, shall be proper solely in the state and federal court nearest to our corporate headquarters.</p>

<p> c) Jury Waiver. In any trial between any of the parties as to any Claims, you and we agree to waive our rights to a jury trial and instead have such action tried by a judge.</p>

<p> d) Class Action Waiver. You agree to bring any Claims, if at all, individually and you shall not join such claim with claims of any other person or entity or bring, join or participate in a class action against us.  e) Punitive Damages Waiver. As to any Claims, you and we agree to waive our rights, if any, to seek or recover punitive damages.</p>

<p> f) Limitation of Actions. You agree to bring any Claims against us, if at all, within one (1) year of the occurrence of the facts giving rise to such Claims, and that any action not brought within this period shall be barred as a claim, counterclaim, defense, or set-off.</p>

<p>g) Prior Notice of Claims. As a condition precedent to commencing an action for a Claim, you must notify us within thirty (30) days after the occurrence of the violation or breach, and failure to timely give such notice shall preclude any claim for damages.</p>

<p>h) Internal Dispute Resolution. You must first bring any Claim to our CEO, after providing notice as in Section 6(g) above. You must exhaust this internal dispute resolution procedure before you may bring your Claim before a third party.</p>

<p> i) Mediation and Arbitration. Before you may bring any Claim against us court, you agree to try for a period of 60 days to mediate such claim before a mutually agreed to mediator in the city or county where our headquarters are located. If we cannot mutually agree on a mediator, you and we agree to use the mediation services of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), and split any AAA and mediator fees equally.</p>

<p> If mediation is unsuccessful and you decide to pursue a legal claim against us, you agree to bring such claim solely in binding arbitration conducted in the city or county of our headquarters in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. The proceedings will be held by a single arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding upon the parties. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having personal and subject matter jurisdiction.</p>

<p>j) Waiver of Bond. You agree that if we are forced to bring suit to enforce any provision of this Agreement, you agree to waive any requirement that we post bond to obtain a temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunction to enforce these duties.</p>

<p>k) Attorney Fees. If we are the substantially prevailing party as to any Claims, you agree to reimburse our costs and attorney fees incurred in pursuing or defending the Claims.</p>

<p>LEASE ADDENDUM</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>1. Use. Tenant is a franchisee of Franchisor. The Leased Premises shall be used only for the operation of an Our Maids business (or any name authorized by Franchisor).</p>

<p>2. Notice of Default and Opportunity To Cure. Landlord shall provide Franchisor with copies of any written notice of default (&ldquo;Default&rdquo;) given to Tenant under the Lease, and Landlord grants to Franchisor the option (but not the obligation) to cure any Default under the Lease (should Tenant fail to do so) within 10 days after the expiration of the period in which Tenant may cure the Default.</p>

<p>3. Termination of Lease. Landlord shall copy Franchisor on any notice of termination of the Lease. If Landlord terminates the Lease for Tenant&rsquo;s Default, Franchisor shall have the option to enter into a new Lease with Landlord on the same terms and conditions as the terminated Lease, subject to Landlord&rsquo;s approval in its reasonable discretion. To exercise this option, Franchisor must notify Landlord within 10 days after Franchisor receives notice of the termination of the Lease.</p>

<p>4. Termination of Franchise Agreement. If the Franchise Agreement between Franchisor and Tenant is terminated during the term of the Lease, then upon the written request of Franchisor, Landlord and Tenant consent to allow Franchisor to assume any existing term of the Lease (the &ldquo;Assumption&rdquo;), provided that any and all defaults have been cured and all payments due under the Lease are current, and to enter into a written agreement providing for such Assumption. In the event of an Assumption, Landlord will deliver possession of the Leased Premises to Franchisor free and clear of any rights of the Tenant or any third party. Landlord further consents to give Franchisor the right, following the Assumption, to assign its interest in the Lease or to sublet the Leased Premises to another franchisee of Franchisor with reasonable consent from the Landlord.</p>

<p>5. Assignment and Subletting. Notwithstanding any provision of the Lease to the contrary, Tenant shall have the right to assign or sublet the Lease to Franchisor, provided that no such assignment or sublease shall relieve Tenant or any guarantor of liability under the Lease. If Franchisor becomes the lessee of the Leased Premises, then Franchisor shall have the right to assign or sublease its lease to a franchisee of Franchisor&rsquo;s brand, subject to Landlord&rsquo;s approval in its reasonable discretion.</p>

<p>6. Authorization. Tenant authorizes Landlord and Franchisor to communicate directly with each other about Tenant and Tenant&rsquo;s business.</p>

<p>7. Right to Enter. Upon the expiration or termination of the Franchise Agreement or the Lease, or the termination of Tenant&rsquo;s right of possession of the Leased Premises, Franchisor or its designee may, after giving reasonable prior notice to Landlord, enter the Leased Premises within 10 days of such expiration or termination, to take any such actions as may be consistent with its rights under this Lease Addendum or to remove signs and other material bearing Franchisor&rsquo;s brand name, trademarks, and commercial symbols.</p>

<p>8. No Liability. By executing this Addendum, Franchisor does not assume any liability with respect to the Leased Premises or any obligation as Tenant under the Lease.</p>

<p>Minn. Stat. &sect;80C.21 and Minn. Rule 2860.4400(J) prohibit the franchisor from requiring litigation to be conducted outside Minnesota, requiring waiver of a jury trial, or requiring the franchisee to consent to liquidated damages, termination penalties or judgment notes. In addition, nothing in the Franchise Disclosure Document or agreements can abrogate or reduce (1) any of the franchisee&rsquo;s rights as provided for in Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 80C, or (2) franchisee&rsquo;s rights to any procedure, forum, or remedies provided for by the laws of the jurisdiction.</p>

<p>With respect to franchises governed by Minnesota law, the franchisor will comply with Minn. Stat. Sec. 80C.14 Subds. 3, 4, and 5 which require (except in certain specified cases), that a franchisee be given 90 days&rsquo; notice of termination (with 60 days to cure) and 180 days&rsquo; notice for non-renewal of the franchise agreement and that consent to the transfer of the franchise will not be unreasonably withheld.</p>

<p>Minnesota considers it unfair to not protect the franchisee&rsquo;s right to use the trademarks. Refer to Minnesota Statutes 80C.12, Subd. 1(g).</p>

<p>Minnesota Rules 2860.4400(D) prohibits a franchisor from requiring a franchisee to assent to a general release.</p>

<p>The franchisee cannot consent to the franchisor obtaining injunctive relief. The franchisor may seek injunctive relief. See Minn. Rules 2860.4400J.</p>

<p>If any of the terms of the Franchise Agreement are inconsistent with the terms below, the terms below control.</p>

<p>In the event of a conflict of laws, the provisions of the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, Chapter 19.100 RCW will prevail.</p>

<p>RCW 19.100.180 may supersede the franchise agreement in your relationship with the franchisor including the areas of termination and renewal of your franchise. There may also be court decisions which may supersede the franchise agreement in your relationship with the franchisor including the areas of termination and renewal of your franchise.</p>

<p>In any arbitration or mediation involving a franchise purchased in Washington, the arbitration or mediation site will be either in the state of Washington, or in a place mutually agreed upon at the time of the arbitration or mediation, or as determined by the arbitrator or mediator at the time of arbitration or mediation. In addition, if litigation is not precluded by the franchise agreement, a franchisee may bring an action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with the sale of franchises, or a violation of the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, in Washington.</p>

<p>A release or waiver of rights executed by a franchisee may not include rights under the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act or any rule or order thereunder except when executed pursuant to a negotiated settlement after the agreement is in effect and where the parties are represented by independent counsel. Provisions such as those which unreasonably restrict or limit the statute of limitations period for claims under the Act, or rights or remedies under the Act such as a right to a jury trial, may not be enforceable.</p>

<p>Transfer fees are collectable to the extent that they reflect the franchisor&rsquo;s reasonable estimated or actual costs in effecting a transfer.</p>

<p>Pursuant to RCW 49.62.020, a noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable against an employee, including an employee of a franchisee, unless the employee&rsquo;s earnings from the party seeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed $100,000 per year (an amount that will be adjusted annually for inflation). In addition, a noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable against an independent contractor of a franchisee under RCW 49.62.030 unless the independent contractor&rsquo;s earnings from the party seeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed $250,000 per year (an amount that will be adjusted annually for inflation). As a result, any provisions contained in the franchise agreement or elsewhere that conflict with these limitations are void and unenforceable in Washington.</p>

<p>RCW 49.62.060 prohibits a franchisor from restricting, restraining, or prohibiting a franchisee from (i) soliciting or hiring any employee of a franchisee of the same franchisor or (ii) soliciting or hiring any employee of the franchisor. As a result, any such provisions contained in the franchise agreement or elsewhere are void and unenforceable in Washington.</p>

<p>Section 17.2.2(a) is modified to also provide that the post-term non-compete will only apply to a 25 mile radius of your Franchised Business.</p>

<p>Section 21.3 is modified to also provide that the indemnification does not extend to liabilities resulting from the gross negligence of willful misconduct of any Franchisor indemnitee.</p>

<p> MINNESOTA ADDENDUM TO THE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT</p>

<p>Minn. Stat. &sect;80C.21 and Minn. Rule 2860.4400(J) prohibit the franchisor from requiring litigation to be conducted outside Minnesota, requiring waiver of a jury trial, or requiring the franchisee to consent to liquidated damages, termination penalties or judgment notes. In addition, nothing in the Franchise Disclosure Document or agreements can abrogate or reduce (1) any of the franchisee&rsquo;s rights as provided for in Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 80C, or (2) franchisee&rsquo;s rights to any procedure, forum, or remedies provided for by the laws of the jurisdiction.</p>

<p>With respect to franchises governed by Minnesota law, the franchisor will comply with Minn. Stat. Sec. 80C.14 Subds. 3, 4, and 5 which require (except in certain specified cases), that a franchisee be given 90 days&rsquo; notice of termination (with 60 days to cure) and 180 days&rsquo; notice for non-renewal of the franchise agreement and that consent to the transfer of the franchise will not be unreasonably withheld.</p>

<p>Minnesota Rules 2860.4400(D) prohibits a franchisor from requiring a franchisee to assent to a general release.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON ADDENDUM TO THE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT</p>

<p>As to franchises governed by the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, if any of the terms of the Disclosure Document are inconsistent with the terms below, the terms below control.</p>

<p>In the event of a conflict of laws, the provisions of the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, Chapter 19.100 RCW will prevail.</p>

<p>RCW 19.100.180 may supersede the franchise agreement in your relationship with the franchisor including the areas of termination and renewal of your franchise. There may also be court decisions which may supersede the franchise agreement in your relationship with the franchisor including the areas of termination and renewal of your franchise.</p>

<p>In any arbitration or mediation involving a franchise purchased in Washington, the arbitration or mediation site will be either in the state of Washington, or in a place mutually agreed upon at the time of the arbitration or mediation, or as determined by the arbitrator or mediator at the time of arbitration or mediation. In addition, if litigation is not precluded by the franchise agreement, a franchisee may bring an action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with the sale of franchises, or a violation of the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, in Washington.</p>

<p>A release or waiver of rights executed by a franchisee may not include rights under the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act or any rule or order thereunder except when executed pursuant to a negotiated settlement after the agreement is in effect and where the parties are represented by independent counsel. Provisions such as those which unreasonably restrict or limit the statute of limitations period for claims under the Act, or rights or remedies under the Act such as a right to a jury trial, may not be enforceable.</p>

<p>Transfer fees are collectable to the extent that they reflect the franchisor&rsquo;s reasonable estimated or actual costs in effecting a transfer.</p>

<p>Pursuant to RCW 49.62.020, a noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable against an employee, including an employee of a franchisee, unless the employee&rsquo;s earnings from the party seeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed $100,000 per year (an amount that will be adjusted annually for inflation). In addition, a noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable against an independent contractor of a franchisee under RCW 49.62.030 unless the independent contractor&rsquo;s earnings from the party seeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed $250,000 per year (an amount that will be adjusted annually for inflation). As a result, any provisions contained in the franchise agreement or elsewhere that conflict with these limitations are void and unenforceable in Washington.</p>

<p>RCW 49.62.060 prohibits a franchisor from restricting, restraining, or prohibiting a franchisee from (i) soliciting or hiring any employee of a franchisee of the same franchisor or (ii) soliciting or hiring any employee of the franchisor. As a result, any such provisions contained in the franchise agreement or elsewhere are void and unenforceable in Washington.</p>

<p>A release or waiver of rights signed by the franchisee shall not include rights under the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act except when executed according to a negotiated settlement after the agreement is in effect and where the parties are represented by independent counsel. Provisions such as those that unreasonably restrict or limit the statute of limitations period for claims under the Act, rights or remedies under the Act such as a right to a jury trial may not be enforceable.</p>

<p>Item 17.r. is modified to also provide that the post-term non-compete will only apply to a 25 mile radius of your Franchised Business.</p>

<p>If the franchise agreement contains any provisions that conflict with the Wisconsin Fair Dealership Law, the provisions of this Addendum shall prevail to the extent of such conflict.</p>

<p>With respect to franchises governed by Wisconsin law, the Wisconsin Fair Dealership Law applies to most, if not all, franchise agreements and prohibits the termination, cancellation, non-renewal or the substantial change of the competitive circumstances of a dealership agreement without good cause. That Law further provides that 90 days&rsquo; prior written notice of a proposed termination, etc. must be given to the dealer. The dealer has 60 days to cure the deficiency and if the deficiency is cured, the notice is void.</p>

These changes may require you to make additional investments in your franchise business or may harm your franchise business.    Supplier restrictions. You may have to buy or lease items from the franchisor or a limited group of suppliers the franchisor designates. These items may be more expensive than similar items you could buy on your own.    Operating restrictions. The franchise agreement may prohibit you from operating a similar business during the term of the franchise. There are usually other restrictions. Some examples may include controlling your location, your access to customers, what you sell, how you market, and your hours of operation.    Competition from franchisor. Even if the franchise agreement grants you a territory, the franchisor may have the right to compete with you in your territory.    Renewal. Your franchise agreement may not permit you to renew. Even if it does, you may have to sign a new agreement with different terms and conditions in order to continue to operate your franchise business.    When your franchise ends. The franchise agreement may prohibit you from operating a similar business after your franchise ends even if you still have obligations to your landlord or other creditors.    Some States Require Registration   Your state may have a franchise law, or other law, that requires franchisors to register before offering or selling franchises in the state. Registration does not mean that the state recommends the franchise or has verified the information in this document. To find out if your state has a registration requirement, or to contact your state, use the agency information in Exhibit A.    Your state also may have laws that require special disclosures or amendments be made to your franchise agreement. If so, you should check the State Specific Addenda. See the Table of Contents for the location of the State Specific Addenda.  </p>

<p>Special Risks to Consider About This Franchise   Certain states require that the following risk(s) be highlighted:     1. Out-of-State Dispute Resolution. The franchise agreement requires you to resolve disputes with the franchisor by mediation, arbitration and/or litigation only in Delaware. Out-of-state mediation, arbitration, or litigation may force you to accept a less favorable settlement for disputes. It may also cost more to mediate, arbitrate, or litigate with the franchisor in Delaware than in your own state.</p>

<p> 2. Short Operating History. The franchisor is at an early stage of development and has a limited operating history. This franchise is likely to be a riskier investment than a franchise in a system with a longer operating history.</p>

<p> 3. Financial Condition. The Franchisor&rsquo;s financial condition as reflected in its financial statements (see Item 21) calls into question the Franchisor&rsquo;s financial ability to provide services and support to you.</p>

<p>Certain states may require other risks to be highlighted. Check the &ldquo;State Specific Addenda&rdquo; (if any) to see whether your state requires other risks to be highlighted.</p>

<p>THE STATE OF MICHIGAN PROHIBITS CERTAIN UNFAIR PROVISIONS THAT ARE SOMETIMES IN FRANCHISE DOCUMENTS. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS ARE IN THESE FRANCHISE DOCUMENTS, THE PROVISIONS ARE VOID AND CANNOT BE ENFORCED AGAINST YOU:</p>

<p>(a) A prohibition on the right of a franchisee to join an association of franchisees.</p>

<p>(b) A requirement that a franchisee assent to a release, assignment, novation, waiver, or estoppel which deprives a franchisee of rights and protections provided in this act. This shall not preclude a franchisee, after entering into a franchise agreement, from settling any and all claims.</p>

<p>(c) A provision that permits a franchisor to terminate a franchise prior to the expiration of its term except for good cause. Good cause shall include the failure of the franchisee to comply with any lawful provision of the franchise agreement and to cure such failure after being given written notice thereof and a reasonable opportunity, which in no event need be more than 30 days, to cure such failure.</p>

<p>(d) A provision that permits a franchisor to refuse to renew a franchise without fairly compensating the franchisee by repurchase or other means for the fair market value at the time of expiration of the franchisee&rsquo;s inventory, supplies, equipment, fixtures, and furnishings. Personalized materials which have no value to the franchisor and inventory, supplies, equipment, fixtures, and furnishings not reasonably required in the conduct of the franchise business are not subject to compensation. This subsection applies only if: (i) The term of the franchise is less than 5 years and (ii) the franchisee is prohibited by the franchise or other agreement from continuing to conduct substantially the same business under another trademark, service mark, trade name, logo type, advertising, or other commercial symbol in the same area subsequent to the expiration of the franchise or the franchisee does not receive at least 6 months advance notice of franchisor&rsquo;s intent not to renew the franchise.</p>

<p>(e) A provision that permits the franchisor to refuse to renew a franchise on terms generally available to other franchisees of the same class or type under similar circumstances. This section does not require a renewal provision.</p>

<p>(f) A provision requiring that arbitration or litigation be conducted outside this state. This shall not preclude the franchisee from entering into an agreement, at the time of arbitration, to conduct arbitration at a location outside this state.</p>

<p>(g) A provision which permits a franchisor to refuse to permit a transfer of ownership of a franchise, except for good cause. This subdivision does not prevent a franchisor from exercising a right of first refusal to purchase the franchise. Good cause shall include, but is not limited to: (i) The failure of the proposed transferee to meet the franchisor&rsquo;s then current reasonable qualifications or standards; (ii) The fact that the proposed transferee is a competitor of the franchisor or subfranchisor; (iii) The unwillingness of the proposed transferee to agree in writing to comply with all lawful obligations; (iv) The failure of the franchisee or proposed transferee to pay any sums owing to the franchisor or to cure any default in the franchise agreement existing at the time of the proposed transfer.</p>

<p>(h) A provision that requires the franchisee to resell to the franchisor items that are not uniquely identified with the franchisor. This subdivision does not prohibit a provision that grants to a franchisor a right of first refusal to purchase the assets of a franchise on the same terms and conditions as a bona fide third party willing and able to purchase those assets, nor does this subdivision prohibit a provision that grants the franchisor the right to acquire the assets of a franchise for the market or appraised value of such assets if the franchisee has breached the lawful provisions of the franchise agreement and has failed to cure the breach in the manner provided in subdivision (c).</p>

<p>(i) A provision which permits the franchisor to directly or indirectly convey, assign, or otherwise transfer its obligation to fulfill contractual obligations to the franchisee unless provision has been made for providing the required contractual services.</p>

<p>11Total- We do not offer financing directly or indirectly for any part of the initial investment.</p>

<p>B. AREA DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT</p>

<p></p>

<p>Note 1- The low-end comprises of the initial franchise fee of $20,000 plus the $20,000 for the additional two outlets ($10,000 x 2). The high-end comprises of the initial franchise fee of $20,000 plus the $50,000 for the additional four outlets ($10,000 x 4).</p>

<p>Note 2-The low-end comprises of the low-end estimate from the Item 7.A table, less the $20,000 initial franchise fee, as it is included in the Area Development Fee ($42,500 - $20,000 = $22,500). The high-end comprises of the high-end estimate from the Item 7.A table, less the $20,000 initial franchise fee, as it is included in the Area Development Fee ($55,250 - $20,000 = $35,250).</p>

<p>The estimates in this Chart 7(B) assume that you will be entering into an Area Development Agreement for the right to open and operate three to five Franchised Businesses within a Development Area and the cost of opening the first Franchised Business.</p>

<p>The Area Development Fee ranges from $40,000 to $60,000 for three to five territories, as explained in Item 5 above. The Area Development Fee includes the Initial Franchise Fee on the first territory purchased under the Development Agreement and one-half the Initial Franchise Fee on additional territories. You pay the remaining one-half of the Initial Franchise Fee on additional territories at the time you enter into Franchise Agreements for such territories.</p>

If you replace your helper s/he must attend our training program. You will be charged for additional training, as provided for in Item 6. Your franchised business must at all times either be under your day-to-day supervision as the Owner/Operator, or by an approved manager who has satisfactorily completed our training program. Additional training shall be at a cost of $250 per person per day if at our location, or $250 per person per day if the training is at your location (plus costs of travel, air fare and incidentals). (Sections 8.1, 8.3, and 8.4 of the Franchise Agreement).</p>

<p>TRAINING PROGRAM</p>

<p></p>

<p> Note 1- Training Location- This training is offered virtually via Zoom.</p>

<p> All persons attending the initial training program must complete the program to our satisfaction. If you cannot complete the program to our satisfaction, we may terminate the Franchise Agreement. (Sections 8.1 and 8.3 of the Franchise Agreement).</p>

<p>The following instructor teaches our initial training program: Antonio Moreno. We describe the nature of the Instructor&rsquo;s experience in Item 2.  We set forth the length of the Instructor&rsquo;s experience in the industry and with the franchisor below:</p>

<p>*Includes years of experience with any of our affiliates. The principal instructional materials will consist of the Operations Manual. From time to time, we may provide and if we do, have the right to require that you attend ongoing training programs, seminars, or webinars during the term of this Agreement, at your expense of $250 per person per day if ongoing training is at our location, or $250 per person per day (plus hotel, air fare and other expenses incurred by our trainer) if ongoing training is at Franchisee&rsquo;s location. We will not require you to attend more than two (2) sessions in any calendar year. You will be responsible for all travel costs, room and board and employees&rsquo; salaries incurred in connection with its attendance at such training. (Section 8.4 of the Franchise Agreement).</p>

<p>ITEM 12. TERRITORY</p>

<p>The territory will be for a specific geographic region that we define and approve by radius, zip codes, natural, or political boundaries as set forth in the Franchise Agreement.</p>

<p>A territory will normally include an area of 200,000 households.</p>

<p>We would not normally have occasion to approve relocation of the franchised business because you will work from your home and a vehicle.</p>

<p>We would not normally grant to you approval to open an additional outlet within your territory, but may grant you additional franchise territories if we feel you have the time, energy, capital, and management structure to be able to successfully open and operate another territory.</p>

<p>We do not grant you options, rights of first refusal, or similar rights to acquire additional franchises.</p>

<p>You will receive an exclusive territory, meaning a geographic area within which we promise not to establish either a company-owned or franchised outlet selling the same or similar goods or services under the same or similar trademarks or service marks.</p>

<p>Continuation of your territorial rights does not depend on achieving a certain sales volume, market penetration, or other contingency, and we may not alter your franchise territory, even if there is a population increase in your territory.</p>

<p>We or an affiliate reserves the right to use other channels of distribution, such as the Internet, catalog sales, telemarketing, or other direct marketing sales, to solicit or accept orders within your territory using our principal trademarks, however, we would normally direct inquiries for services from within your territory to your outlet.</p>

<p>We or an affiliate also reserves the right to use other channels of distribution, such as the Internet, catalog sales, telemarketing, or other direct marketing sales, to make sales within your territory of products or services under trademarks different from the ones that you will use under the franchise agreement.</p>

<p>We are not obligated to pay compensation to you for soliciting or accepting orders from inside your territory.</p>

<p>You and other franchisees may not solicit (but may accept) orders from consumers outside of your territory, including through the use of other channels of distribution, such as the Internet, catalog sales, telemarketing, or other direct marketing, but you may engage in internet and social media marketing pursuant to our guidelines which such marketing may extend outside your territory. We also reserve the right to implement cross-territorial protocols and other guidelines applicable to such situations as group advertising buys by multiple franchisees which may extend into multiple territories, solicitation of orders of individuals who may reside in one territory, yet work in another, and other cross-territorial situations. You agree to abide by any such cross-territorial protocols.</p>

<p>Neither we nor an affiliate operates, franchises, or has plans to operate or franchise a business under a different trademark which such business sells or will sell goods or services similar to those you will offer, but we reserve the right to do so.</p>

<p>Area Developers:</p>

<p> Under the Area Development Agreement (the &ldquo;ADA&rdquo;), you will develop, open and operate multiple outlets within a defined Development Area (the &ldquo;Development Area&rdquo;). We determine the Development Area using the same criteria that we use in deciding the Territory for a Business.</p>

<p>ITEM 13. TRADEMARKS</p>

<p>The franchise agreement licenses to you the right to use the following principal trademarks (&ldquo;Marks&rdquo;) registered or applied for with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (&ldquo;USPTO&rdquo;):</p>

<p></p>

<p> We do not have a federal registration for our principal trademark. SERIAL/ REGISTRATION NO. 7036264: PRINCIPAL REGISTER: REGISTRATION DATE, APRIL 25, 2023.</p>

<p>There are no currently effective agreements that significantly limit our rights to use or license the use of our trademarks listed in this section.</p>

<p>There are no currently effective determinations of the USPTO, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, or any state trademark administrator or any court; or any pending infringement, opposition, or cancellation proceeding in which we unsuccessfully sought to prevent registration of a trademark in order to protect a trademark licensed by the franchisor. There is no pending material federal or state court litigation regarding our use or ownership rights in a trademark.</p>

<p>We know of no infringing or prior superior uses that could materially affect the use of the Marks.</p>

<p>You do not receive any rights to the Marks other than the right to use them in the operation of your Franchised Business. You must follow our rules when you use the Marks. You must use the Marks as the sole trade identification of the franchised business. You cannot use any Mark or portion of any Mark as part of any business entity name. You may not use any Mark in connection with the sale of any unauthorized services or products, or in any other manner that we do not authorize in writing. You must obtain a fictitious or assumed name registration if required by your state or local law. Any unauthorized use of the Marks by you is a breach of the Franchise Agreement and an infringement of our rights in the Marks. You must not contest the validity or ownership of the Marks, including any Marks that we license to you after you sign the Franchise Agreement. You must not assist any other person in contesting the validity or ownership of the Marks.</p>

<p>You must immediately notify us in writing when you learn about any claim of infringement, unfair competition, or similar claims about the Marks. You must not communicate with any person other than us and our counsel regarding any infringements, challenges or claims unless you are legally required to do so. However, you may communicate with your own counsel at your own expense. We are not required to take affirmative action when notified of these uses or claims. We have the sole right to control any administrative or judicial proceeding involving a trademark licensed by us. The Franchise Agreement does not require us to participate in your defense or indemnify you for expenses or damages if you are a party to an administrative or judicial proceeding involving a trademark licensed by us to you or if the proceeding is resolved unfavorable to you. You must take any actions that, in the opinion of our counsel, may be advisable to protect and maintain our interests in any proceeding or to otherwise protect and maintain our interests in the Marks.</p>

<p>If we require, you must modify or discontinue the use of any Mark and use other trademarks or service marks we designate. We do not have to reimburse you for modifying or discontinuing the use of a Mark or for substituting another trademark or service mark for a discontinued Mark. If we adopt and use new or modified Marks, you must add or replace equipment, supplies and fixtures, and you must make other modifications we designate as necessary to adapt your franchised business for the new or modified Marks. We do not reimburse you for any loss of goodwill associated with a modified or discontinued Mark.</p>

<p>You must notify us if you apply for your own trademark or service mark registrations. You must not register or seek to register as a trademark or service mark, either with the USPTO or any state or foreign country, any of the Marks or a trademark or service mark that is confusingly similar to any of our Marks.</p>

<p>ITEM 14. PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION</p>

We own copyrights in the Operations Manual, our website, our marketing materials, training manuals or videos, and other copyrightable items that are part of the System.

You may use these items only as we specify while operating the Franchised Business and you must stop using them if we direct you to do so.</p>

<p>We do not have an obligation to protect the copyrights or to defend you against claims arising from your use of the copyrighted items. You must notify us if any claim for copyright infringement is brought against you over materials in which we claim a copyright. We have the right to control litigation over our copyrights. We are not required to participate in your defense or indemnify you for expenses and damages in a proceeding involving a copyright licensed to you. Your rights in the franchise agreement would continue if we require you to modify or discontinue using the subject matter covered by the copyright.</p>

<p>We know of no effective determinations of the U.S. Copyright Office or any court regarding any of our copyrighted materials. Our right to use or license copyrighted items is not materially limited by any agreement or known infringing use.</p>

<p>We have developed certain trade secrets and other confidential information, including methods of business management, sales and promotion techniques, and know-how, knowledge of, and experience in, operating an Our Maids Business. We will provide our trade secrets and other confidential information to you during training, in the Operations Manual and as a result of the assistance we furnish you during the term of the franchise. You may only use the trade secrets and other confidential information for the purpose of operating your Franchised Business. You may only divulge trade secrets and/or other confidential information to employees who must have access to it to operate the Franchised Business. You are responsible for enforcing the confidentiality provisions as to your employees.</p>

<p>Certain individuals with access to trade secrets or other confidential information, including your shareholders, officers, directors, partners, members, if you are a corporation, limited liability company or other business entity, and your managers, executives, employees and staff may be required to sign nondisclosure and non-competition agreements in a form the same as or similar to the Nondisclosure and Non-Competition Agreement attached to the Franchise Agreement. We will be a third-party beneficiary with the right to enforce those agreements.</p>

<p>All ideas, concepts, techniques or materials concerning the franchised business and/or the System, whether or not protectable intellectual property and whether created by or for you or your owners or employees, must be promptly disclosed to us and will be deemed our sole and exclusive property and a part of the System that we may choose to adopt and/or disclose to other franchisees, and you agree to assign to us all right, title and interest in any intellectual property so developed without additional compensation to you. Likewise, we will disclose to you concepts and developments of other franchisees that we make part of the System. You must also assist us in obtaining intellectual property rights in any concept or development if requested.</p>

<p>Your use of the Operations Manual, trade secrets or other confidential information in an unauthorized manner is a default of the Franchise Agreement that may result in automatic termination of the Franchise Agreement. Further information about termination of the Franchise Agreement following a default is included in Item 17.</p>

<p>ITEM 15. OBLIGATION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ACTUAL OPERATION OF THE FRANCHISE BUSINESS</p>

<p>Either the Franchisee or its on-site Designated Manager must devote sufficient efforts to the management of the day-to-day operations of the Franchised Business, but not less than forty (40) hours per week. While you have the right to select any Designated Manager, we retain the right to accept or reject any proposed individual or entity as the Designated Manager. You will be responsible for the compensation to any individual or entity you contract to act as the Designated Manager of the Business. You have the sole legal responsibility for any dispute relating to such individual or entity. We maintain the right to require any approved Designated Manager to attend and satisfactorily complete our initial training program before opening the Business. You must keep us informed at all times of the identity of your Designated Manager. If you must replace the Designated Manager, your replacement Manager must be approved by us within 60 days, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld &ndash; we may additionally require such replacement Designated Manager to attend and complete our training program at your expense. If the Franchisee is an entity, its Designated Manager is not required to own an equity interest in the Franchisee.</p>

<p>As described in ITEM 14, certain individuals associated with your Franchised Business, including your owners, officers, directors, partners, and your managers, executives, employees, and staff may be required to sign nondisclosure and non-competition agreements the same as or similar to the Nondisclosure and Non-Competition Agreement attached to the Franchise Agreement. We will be a third-party beneficiary with the independent right to enforce the agreements.</p>

<p>If you are a corporation or other business entity, anyone who owns a 5% or greater interest in the entity must personally guarantee the performance of all of your obligations under the Franchise Agreement and agree to be personally liable for your breach of the Franchise Agreement by signing the Unlimited Guaranty and Assumption of Obligations attached to the Franchise Agreement.</p>

You may not sell any services or products that we have not authorized and you must discontinue offering any services or products that we may disapprove of. We may take action, including terminating your franchise if you purchase or sell unapproved products or make purchases from unapproved suppliers. We may periodically change required or authorized services or products. There are no limits on our right to do so, except that your investment required to change required or authorized products or services will not be unreasonably disproportionate to your initial investment.</p>

<p>Periodically, we may allow certain services or products that are not otherwise authorized for general use as a part of the System to be offered locally or regionally based on factors, including test marketing, your qualifications, and regional or local differences.</p>

Franchisor shall not charge for this service. Franchisor&rsquo;s advice or guidance to Franchisee relative to prices for products and services that, in Franchisor&rsquo;s judgment, constitutes good business practice is based upon the experience of Franchisor and its franchisees in operating Our Maids businesses and an analysis of costs and prices charged for competitive products and services. Within range, Franchisee shall have the right to change/determine the price to be charged for a particular service by the Franchised Business at the time of sale (if necessary).

<p> 17.2.2 Except as otherwise approved in writing by Franchisor, neither Franchisee, nor any holder of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisee, nor any officer, director, executive, manager or member of the professional staff of Franchisee, shall, for a period of two (2) years after the expiration or termination of this Agreement, regardless of the cause of termination, either directly or indirectly: offer Competitive Business services located or operating (a) at or within a twenty-five (25) mile radius of the Franchised Business, or (b) within a twenty-five (25) mile radius of any other Our Maids Business in existence at the time of termination or expiration, or (c) any other business owned or operated by the Franchisor in existence at the time of termination or expansion;</p>

<p>solicit or otherwise attempt to induce or influence any customer or other business associate of Franchisor to terminate or modify his, her or its business relationship with Franchisor or to compete against Franchisor; or</p>

<p>In furtherance of this Section, Franchisor has the right to require certain individuals to execute standard form nondisclosure or non-competition agreements in a form the same as or similar to the Nondisclosure and Non-Competition Agreement attached as Schedule 2.</p>

<p>17.3 Unfair Competition</p>

<p> If Franchisee operates any other business, Franchisee shall not use any reproduction, counterfeit, copy or colorable imitation of the Marks, either in connection with such other business or the promotion thereof, that is likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception, or that is likely to dilute Franchisor&rsquo;s rights in the Marks. Franchisee shall not utilize any designation of origin, description or representation that falsely suggests or represents an association or connection with Franchisor. This Section is not intended as an approval of Franchisee&rsquo;s right to operate other businesses and in no way is it intended to contradict Sections 17, 17.1 or 17.2. Franchisee shall make such modifications or alterations to the Franchised Business (including changing telephone and facsimile numbers) immediately upon termination or expiration of this Agreement as may be necessary to prevent any association between Franchisor or the System and any business subsequently operated by Franchisee or others at the Franchised Business. Franchisee shall make such specific additional changes to the Franchised Business as Franchisor may reasonably request for that purpose including, without limitation, removal of all physical and structural features identifying or distinctive to the System. If Franchisee fails or refuses to comply with the requirements of this Section, Franchisor has the right to enter upon the Franchised Business for the purpose of making or causing to be made such changes as may be required, at the expense of Franchisee, which expense Franchisee shall pay upon demand.</p>

<p>17.4 Franchisor&rsquo;s Option to Purchase Certain Business Assets</p>

<p> Franchisor has the right (but not the obligation), for a period of thirty (30) days after termination or expiration of this Agreement, to purchase any or all assets of the Franchised Business including improvements, vehicles, service tools and equipment, supplies and other inventory or equipment. The purchase price shall be equal to the assets&rsquo; book value. If Franchisor elects to exercise this option to purchase, it has the right to set off all amounts due from Franchisee under this Agreement, if any, against the purchase price.</p>

<p>17.5 Survival of Certain Provisions</p>

<p> All obligations of Franchisor and Franchisee, which expressly or by their nature survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement, shall continue in full force and effect subsequent to and notwithstanding their expiration or termination and until satisfied or by their nature expire.</p>

<p>18. TRANSFERABILITY OF INTEREST</p>

<p>18.1 Transfer by Franchisor</p>

<p> This Agreement and all rights and duties hereunder are fully transferable in whole or in part by Franchisor and such rights will inure to the benefit of any person or entity to whom transferred; provided, however, that with respect to any assignment resulting in the subsequent performance by the assignee of the functions of Franchisor, the assignee shall assume the obligations of Franchisor hereunder and Franchisor shall thereafter have no liability for the performance of any obligations contained in this Agreement.</p>

<p>18.2 Transfer by Franchisee to a Third Party</p>

<p> The rights and duties of Franchisee as in this Agreement, and the Franchise herein granted, are personal to Franchisee (or its owners), and Franchisor has entered into this Agreement in reliance upon Franchisee&rsquo;s personal or collective skill and financial ability. Accordingly, neither Franchisee nor any holder of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisee may sell, assign, convey, give away, pledge, mortgage, sublicense or otherwise transfer, whether by operation of law or otherwise, any interest in this Agreement, the Franchise granted hereby, the assets of the Franchised Business or any part or all of the ownership interest in Franchisee without the prior written approval of Franchisor. Any purported transfer without such approval shall be null and void and shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement. If Franchisee is in compliance with this Agreement, Franchisor&rsquo;s consent to such transfer shall be conditioned upon the satisfaction of the following requirements:</p>

<p>Franchisee has complied with the requirements in Section 19;</p>

<p>all obligations owed to Franchisor, and all other outstanding obligations relating to the Franchised Business, are fully paid and satisfied;</p>

<p>Franchisee (and any transferring owners, if Franchisee is a business entity) has executed a general release, in a form the same as or similar to the General Release attached as Schedule 1, of any and all claims against Franchisor, including its officers, directors, shareholders, managers, members, partners, owners, employees and agents (in their corporate and individual capacities), including, without limitation, claims arising under federal, state or local laws, rules or ordinances, and any other matters incident to the termination of this Agreement or to the transfer of Franchisee&rsquo;s interest herein or to the transfer of Franchisee&rsquo;s ownership of all or any part of the Franchise; provided, however, that if a general release is prohibited, Franchisee shall give the maximum release allowed by law;</p>

<p>the prospective transferee has satisfied Franchisor that it meets Franchisor&rsquo;s management, business and financial standards, and otherwise possesses the character and capabilities, including business reputation and credit rating, as Franchisor may require to demonstrate ability to conduct the Franchised Business;</p>

<p>the transferee and, if Franchisor requires, all persons owning any interest in the transferee, have executed the then-current franchise agreement for new franchisees, which may be substantially different from this Agreement, including different Royalty Fee and other material provisions, and the franchise agreement then executed shall be for the term specified in such agreement;</p>

<p>the transferee has executed a general release, in a form the same as or similar to the General Release attached as Schedule 1, of any and all claims against Franchisor and its officers, directors, shareholders, managers, members, partners, owners, employees and agents (in their corporate and individual capacities), with respect to any representations regarding the Franchise or the business conducted pursuant thereto or any other matter that may have been made to the transferee by Franchisee;</p>

<p>Franchisee has provided Franchisor with a complete copy of all contracts and agreements and related documentation between Franchisee and the prospective transferee relating to the intended sale or transfer of the Franchise;</p>

<p>Franchisee, or the transferee, has paid to Franchisor, before the transaction is completed, a transfer fee in the amount of 25% of the then current initial franchise fee;</p>

<p>the transferee, or all holders of a legal or beneficial interest in the transferee, has agreed to be personally bound jointly and severally by all provisions of this Agreement for the remainder of its term by executing a personal guaranty in such form as prepared by Franchisor;</p>

<p>the transferee has obtained all necessary consents and approvals by third parties and all applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules, ordinances, and requirements applicable to the transfer have been complied with or satisfied;</p>

<p>Franchisee has, and if Franchisee is an entity, all of the holders of a legal and beneficial interest in Franchisee have executed and delivered to Franchisor a nondisclosure and non-competition agreement in a form satisfactory to Franchisor and in substance the same as the nondisclosure and non-competition covenants contained in Sections 7 and 17; and</p>

<p>the transferee agrees that it shall complete, to Franchisor&rsquo;s satisfaction, a training program in substance similar to the initial training described in Section 8.1 prior to assuming the management of the day-to-day operation of the Franchised Business.</p>

<p>18.3 Transfer to a Controlled Entity</p>

<p> 18.3.1 If Franchisee wishes to transfer this Agreement or any interest herein to a corporation, limited liability company or other legal entity which shall be entirely owned by Franchisee (&ldquo;Controlled Entity&rdquo;), which Controlled Entity is being formed for the financial planning, tax or other convenience of Franchisee, Franchisor&rsquo;s consent to such transfer shall be conditioned upon the satisfaction of the following requirements:</p>

<p>the Controlled Entity is newly organized and its charter or articles of formation provides that its activities are confined exclusively to the operation of the Franchised Business;</p>

<p>Franchisee or all holders of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisee own all of the equity and voting power of the outstanding stock or other capital interest in the Controlled Entity;</p>

<p>all obligations of Franchisee to Franchisor or any Affiliate are fully paid and satisfied; provided, however, that neither Franchisee nor the Controlled Entity shall be required to pay a transfer fee as required according to Section 18.2(h);</p>

<p>the Controlled Entity has entered into a written agreement with Franchisor expressly assuming the obligations of this Agreement and all other agreements relating to the operation of the Franchised Business. If the consent of any other party to any such other agreement is required, Franchisee has obtained such written consent and provided the same to Franchisor prior to consent by Franchisor;</p>

<p>all holders of a legal or beneficial interest in the Controlled Entity have entered into an agreement with Franchisor jointly and severally guaranteeing the full payment of the Controlled Entity&rsquo;s obligations to Franchisor and the performance by the Controlled Entity of all the obligations of this Agreement;</p>

<p>each stock certificate or other ownership interest certificate of the Controlled Entity has conspicuously endorsed upon the face thereof a statement in a form satisfactory to Franchisor that it is held subject to, and that further assignment or transfer thereof is subject to, all restrictions imposed upon transfers and assignments by this Agreement; and</p>

<p>copies of the Controlled Entity&rsquo;s articles of incorporation or organization, bylaws, operating agreement, federal tax identification number, and other governing regulations or documents, including resolutions of the board of directors authorizing entry into this Agreement, have been promptly furnished to Franchisor. Any amendment to any such documents shall also be furnished to Franchisor immediately upon adoption.</p>

<p> 18.3.2 The term of the transferred franchise shall be the unexpired term of this Agreement, including all renewal rights, subject to any and all conditions applicable to such renewal rights.</p>

<p> 18.3.3 Franchisor&rsquo;s consent to a transfer of any interest in this Agreement, or of any ownership interest in the Franchised Business, shall not constitute a waiver of any claims Franchisor may have against the transferor or the transferee, nor shall it be deemed a waiver of Franchisor&rsquo;s right to demand compliance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>

<p>18.4 Franchisor&rsquo;s Disclosure to Transferee</p>

<p> Franchisor has the right, without liability of any kind or nature whatsoever to Franchisee, to make available for inspection by any intended transferee of Franchisee all or any part of Franchisor&rsquo;s records relating to this Agreement, the Franchised Business or to the history of the relationship of the parties hereto. Franchisee hereby specifically consents to such disclosure by Franchisor and shall release and hold Franchisor harmless from and against any claim, loss or injury resulting from an inspection of Franchisor&rsquo;s records relating to the Franchised Business by an intended transferee identified by Franchisee.</p>

<p>18.5 For-Sale Advertising</p>

<p> Franchisee shall NOT, without prior written consent of Franchisor, place in, on or upon the area of the Franchised Business, or in any communication media, any form of advertising relating to the sale of the Franchised Business or the rights granted hereunder.</p>

<p>18.6 Transfer by Death or Incapacity</p>

<p> Upon the death or Incapacity of Franchisee (if Franchisee is an individual) or any holder of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisee (if Franchisee is a business entity), the appropriate representative of such person (whether administrator, personal representative or trustee) shall, within a reasonable time not exceeding one hundred eighty (180) days following such event, transfer such individual&rsquo;s interest in the Franchised Business or in Franchisee to a third party approved by Franchisor. Such transfers, including transfers by will or inheritance, shall be subject to the conditions for assignments and transfers contained in this Agreement. During such one hundred eighty (180) day period, the Franchised Business must remain at all times under the primary management of a Designated Manager who otherwise meets Franchisor&rsquo;s management qualifications.</p>

<p> Following such a death or Incapacity of such person as described in this Section 18.6, if necessary in Franchisor&rsquo;s discretion, Franchisor shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assume operation of the Franchised Business until the deceased or incapacitated owner&rsquo;s interest is transferred to a third party approved by Franchisor. Franchisor shall be given access to the Franchised Business, even if located within Franchisee&rsquo;s or its Designated Manager&rsquo;s principal residence, and shall not be held liable for trespass or any related tort. Franchisor may charge a management fee as stated in the Operations Manual from time to time, currently equal to $250 per person per day, and Franchisor shall be entitled to reimbursement of any expenses Franchisor incurs that are not paid out of the operating cash flow of the Franchised Business.</p>

<p>19. RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL</p>

<p>19.1 Submission of Offer</p>

<p> If Franchisee, or any of its owners, proposes to sell or otherwise transfer (including a transfer by death or Incapacity according to Section 18.6) the Franchised Business (or any of its assets outside of the normal course of business), any ownership interest in Franchisee or any ownership interest in the Franchise granted hereunder, Franchisee shall obtain and deliver a bona fide, executed written offer or proposal to purchase, along with all pertinent documents including any contract or due diligence materials, to Franchisor, except with regards to a sale or transfer to a family member. The offer must apply only to an approved sale of the assets or interests listed above and may not include any other property or rights of Franchisee or any of its owners.</p>

<p>19.2 Franchisor&rsquo;s Right to Purchase</p>

<p> Franchisor shall, for thirty (30) days from the date of delivery of all such documents, have the right, exercisable by written notice to Franchisee, to purchase the offered assets or interest for the price and on the same terms and conditions contained in such offer communicated to Franchisee. Franchisor has the right to substitute cash for the fair market value of any form of payment proposed in such offer. Franchisor&rsquo;s credit shall be deemed at least equal to the credit of any proposed buyer. After providing notice to Franchisee of Franchisor&rsquo;s intent to exercise this right of first refusal, Franchisor shall have up to sixty (60) days to close the purchase. Franchisor shall be entitled to receive from Franchisee all customary representations and warranties given by Franchisee as the seller of the assets or such ownership interest or, at Franchisor&rsquo;s election, such representations and warranties contained in the proposal.</p>

<p>19.3 Non-Exercise of Right of First Refusal</p>

<p> If Franchisor does not exercise its right of first refusal within thirty (30) days from the date of delivery of all such documents, the offer or proposal may be accepted by Franchisee or any of its owners, subject to Franchisor&rsquo;s prior written approval as required by Section 18.2. Should the sale fail to close within 120 days after the offer is delivered to Franchisor, Franchisor&rsquo;s right of first refusal shall renew and be implemented in accordance with this Section.</p>

<p>19.4 Sales or Transfers to Family Excepted</p>

<p> If Franchisee proposes to sell or otherwise transfer the Franchised Business (or any of its assets outside of the normal course of business), any ownership interest in Franchisee or any ownership interest in the Franchise granted hereunder to a member of Franchisee&rsquo;s (or its owners&rsquo;) family, then the terms and conditions of this Section shall be inapplicable. Nothing in this Section 19.4 shall be construed to relieve Franchisee from full compliance with the terms and conditions of Section 18.2 prior to a sale or transfer to family according to this Section.</p>

<p>20. BENEFICIAL OWNERS OF FRANCHISEE</p>

<p> Franchisee represents, and Franchisor enters into this Agreement in reliance upon such representation, that the individual(s) identified in Schedule 6 is/are the sole holder(s) of a legal or beneficial interest (in the stated percentages) of Franchisee.</p>

<p>21. RELATIONSHIP AND INDEMNIFICATION</p>

<p>21.1 Relationship</p>

<p> This Agreement is purely a contractual relationship between the parties and does not appoint or make Franchisee an agent, legal representative, joint-venturer, partner, employee, servant, or independent contractor of Franchisor for any purpose whatsoever. Franchisee may not represent or imply to third parties that Franchisee is an agent of Franchisor, and Franchisee is in no way authorized to make any contract, agreement, warranty, or representation on behalf of Franchisor, or to create any obligation, express or implied, on Franchisor&rsquo;s behalf. During the term of this Agreement, and any extension or renewal hereof, Franchisee shall hold itself out to the public only as a franchisee and an owner of the Franchised Business operating the Franchised Business according to a franchise from Franchisor. Franchisee shall take such affirmative action as may be necessary to do so including, without limitation, exhibiting a notice of that fact in a conspicuous place on all forms, stationery or other written materials, the content of which Franchisor has the right to specify. Under no circumstances shall Franchisor be liable for any act, omission, contract, debt, nor any other obligation of Franchisee. Franchisor shall in no way be responsible for any injuries to persons or property resulting from the operation of the Franchised Business by Franchisee. Any third-party contractors and vendors retained by Franchisee to convert or construct the premises are independent contractors of Franchisee alone.</p>

<p>21.2 Standard of Care</p>

<p> This Agreement does not establish a fiduciary relationship between the parties.</p>

<p>21.3 Indemnification</p>

<p> Franchisee shall hold harmless and indemnify Franchisor, any Affiliate, all holders of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisor and all officers, directors, executives, managers, members, partners, owners, employees, agents, successors and assigns (collectively &ldquo;Franchisor Indemnities&rdquo;) from and against all losses, damages, fines, costs, expenses or liability (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and all other costs of litigation) incurred in connection with any action, suit, demand, claim, investigation or proceeding, or any settlement thereof, which arises from or is based upon Franchisee&rsquo;s (a) ownership or operation of the Franchised Business; (b) violation, breach or asserted violation or breach of any federal, state or local law, regulation or rule; (c) breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or provision of this Agreement or any other agreement between Franchisee and Franchisor (or an Affiliate); (d) defamation of Franchisor or the System; (e) acts, errors or omissions committed or incurred in connection with the Franchised Business; or (f) infringement, violation or alleged infringement or violation of any Mark, patent or copyright or any misuse of the Trade Secrets or other Confidential Information. The obligations of this Section 21.3 shall expressly survive the termination of this Agreement.</p>

<p>21.4 Right to Retain Counsel</p>

<p> Franchisee shall give Franchisor immediate notice of any such action, suit, demand, claim, investigation, or proceeding that may give rise to a claim for indemnification by a Franchisor Indemnity. Franchisor has the right to retain counsel of its own choosing in connection with any such action, suit, demand, claim, investigation or proceeding. In order to protect persons, property, Franchisor&rsquo;s reputation or the goodwill of others, Franchisor has the right to, at any time without notice, take such remedial or corrective actions as it deems expedient with respect to any action, suit, demand, claim, investigation or proceeding if, in Franchisor&rsquo;s sole judgment, there are grounds to believe any of the acts or circumstances listed above have occurred. If Franchisor&rsquo;s exercise of its rights under this Section causes any of Franchisee&rsquo;s insurers to refuse to pay a third-party claim, all cause of action and legal remedies Franchisee might have against such insurer shall automatically be assigned to Franchisor without the need for any further action on either party&rsquo;s part. Under no circumstances shall Franchisor be required or obligated to seek coverage from third parties or otherwise mitigate losses in order to maintain a claim against Franchisee. The failure to pursue such remedy or mitigate such loss shall in no way reduce the amounts recoverable by Franchisor from Franchisee. Franchisee agrees to not be a party to class action suit against the Franchisor or any of its Affiliates under any circumstances.</p>

<p>22. GENERAL CONDITIONS AND PROVISIONS</p>

<p>22.1 No Waiver</p>

<p> No failure of Franchisor to exercise any power reserved to it hereunder, or to insist upon strict compliance by Franchisee with any obligation or condition hereunder, and no custom nor practice of the parties in variance with the terms hereof, shall constitute a waiver of Franchisor&rsquo;s right to demand exact compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Waiver by Franchisor of any particular default by Franchisee shall not be binding unless in writing and executed by Franchisor and shall not affect nor impair Franchisor&rsquo;s right with respect to any subsequent default of the same or of a different nature. Subsequent acceptance by Franchisor of any payment(s) due shall not be deemed to be a waiver by Franchisor of any preceding breach by Franchisee of any terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement.</p>

<p>22.2 Injunctive Relief</p>

<p> As any breach by Franchisee of any of the restrictions contained in Sections 6, 7, and 17 would result in irreparable injury to Franchisor, and as the damages arising out of any such breach would be difficult to ascertain, in addition to all other remedies provided by law or in equity, Franchisor shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief (whether a restraining order, a preliminary injunction or a permanent injunction) against any such breach, whether actual or contemplated, without the necessity of posting security or bond and Franchisee shall be responsible for Franchisor&rsquo;s reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees incurred in pursuing the same. Franchisor&rsquo;s right to seek injunctive relief will not affect the parties&rsquo; waiver of jury trial and covenant to arbitrate all disputes in accordance with Section 23.7. Franchisor&rsquo;s rights herein shall include pursuing injunctive relief through arbitration or in a state or federal court.</p>

<p>22.3 Notices</p>

<p> All notices required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed received: (a) at the time delivered by hand to the recipient party (or to an officer, director or partner of the recipient party); (b) on the next business day after transmission by facsimile or other reasonably reliable electronic communication system; (c) two (2) business days after being sent via guaranteed overnight delivery by a commercial courier service; or (d) five (5) business days after being sent by Registered Mail, return receipt requested. Either party may change its address by a written notice sent in accordance with this Section 22.3. All notices, payments and reports required by this Agreement shall be sent to Franchisor at the following address, or at such other address as Franchisor may provide:</p>

<p> Our Maids Franchise, Inc.  Attn.: Antonio Moreno  8 The Green, Suite 14095  Dover, DE 19901</p>

<p>22.4 Cost of Enforcement or Defense</p>

<p> If Franchisor is required to enforce this Agreement in a judicial or arbitration proceeding, if it is the prevailing party, it shall be entitled to reimbursement of its costs, including reasonable accounting and attorneys&rsquo; fees, in connection with such proceeding.</p>

<p>22.5 Unlimited Guaranty and Assumption of Obligations</p>

<p> All holders of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisee of five percent (5%) or greater shall be required to execute, as of the date of this Agreement, the Unlimited Guaranty and Assumption of Obligations attached as Schedule 3, through which such holders agree to assume and discharge all of Franchisee&rsquo;s obligations under this Agreement and to be personally liable hereunder for all of the same.</p>

<p>22.6 Approvals</p>

<p> Whenever this Agreement requires the prior approval or consent of Franchisor, Franchisee shall make a timely written request to Franchisor for such approval and, except as otherwise provided herein, any approval or consent granted shall be effective only if in writing. Franchisor makes no warranties or guarantees upon which Franchisee may rely, and assumes no liability or obligation to Franchisee or any third party to which it would not otherwise be subject, by providing any waiver, approval, advice, consent or services to Franchisee in connection with this Agreement, or by reason of any neglect, delay or denial of any request for approval.</p>

<p>22.7 Entire Agreement</p>

<p> This Agreement and all exhibits to this Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties and supersede any and all prior negotiations, understandings, representations, and agreements. Nothing in this or in any related agreement, however, is intended to disclaim the representations we made in the franchise disclosure document that we furnished to you. No amendment, change or variance from this Agreement shall be binding on either party unless executed in writing by both parties.</p>

<p>22.8 Severability and Modification</p>

<p> Except as noted below, each paragraph, part, term and provision of this Agreement shall be considered severable. If any paragraph, part, term or provision herein is ruled to be unenforceable, unreasonable or invalid, such ruling shall not impair the operation of or affect the remaining portions, paragraphs, parts, terms and provisions of this Agreement, and the latter shall continue to be given full force and effect and bind the parties; and such unenforceable, unreasonable or invalid paragraphs, parts, terms or provisions shall be deemed not part of this Agreement.</p>

<p> Notwithstanding the above, each of the covenants contained in Sections 7 and 17 shall be construed as independent of any other covenant or provision of this Agreement. If all or any portion of any such covenant is held to be unenforceable, unreasonable, or invalid, then it shall be amended to provide for limitations on disclosure of Trade Secrets or other Confidential Information or on competition to the maximum extent provided or permitted by law.</p>

<p>22.9 Construction</p>

<p> All captions herein are intended solely for the convenience of the parties, and none shall be deemed to affect the meaning or construction of any provision hereof.</p>

<p>22.10 Force Majeure</p>

<p> Whenever a period of time is provided in this Agreement for either party to perform any act, except pay monies, neither party shall be liable nor responsible for any delays due to strikes, lockouts, casualties, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental regulation or control or other causes beyond the reasonable control of the parties, and the time period for the performance of such act shall be extended for the amount of time of the delay. This clause shall not result in an extension of the term of this Agreement.</p>

<p>22.11 Timing</p>

<p> Time is of the essence. Except as in Section 22.10, failure to perform any act within the time required or permitted by this Agreement shall be a material breach.</p>

<p>22.12 Withholding Payments</p>

<p> Franchisee shall not, for any reason, withhold payment of any Royalty Fees or other amounts due to Franchisor or to an Affiliate. Franchisee shall not withhold or offset any amounts, damages or other monies allegedly due to Franchisee against any amounts due to Franchisor. No endorsement or statement on any payment for less than the full amount due to Franchisor will be construed as an acknowledgment of payment in full, or an accord and satisfaction, and Franchisor has the right to accept and cash any such payment without prejudice to Franchisor&rsquo;s right to recover the full amount due, or pursue any other remedy provided in this Agreement or by law. Franchisor has the right to apply any payments made by Franchisee against any of Franchisee&rsquo;s past due indebtedness as Franchisor deems appropriate. Franchisor shall set off sums Franchisor owes to Franchisee against any unpaid debts owed by Franchisee to Franchisor.</p>

<p>22.13 Further Assurances</p>

<p> Each party to this Agreement will execute and deliver such further instruments, contracts, forms or other documents, and will perform such further acts, as may be necessary or desirable to perform or complete any term, covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement.</p>

<p>22.14 Third Party Beneficiaries</p>

<p> Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, nothing in this Agreement is intended, nor shall be deemed, to confer upon any person or legal entity other than Franchisor or Franchisee, and their respective successors and assigns as may be contemplated by this Agreement, any rights or remedies under this Agreement.</p>

<p>22.15 Multiple Originals</p>

<p> Both parties will execute multiple copies of this Agreement, and each executed copy will be deemed an original.</p>

<p>23. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</p>

<p>23.1 Choice of Law</p>

<p> Except as to claims governed by federal law, Delaware law governs all claims that in any way relate to or arise out of this Agreement or any of the dealings of the parties (&ldquo;Claims&rdquo;). However, no laws regulating the sale of franchises or governing the relationship between franchisor and franchisee shall apply unless the jurisdictional requirements of such laws are met independently of this paragraph.</p>

<p>23.2 Jurisdiction and Venue</p>

<p> You and we agree that venue and jurisdiction for any Claims, except those required to be submitted to arbitration, shall be proper solely in the state and federal court nearest to our corporate headquarters, presently located in Dover, Delaware. However, if you are an Illinois, Maryland, or Washington State resident or your franchise territory is located in Illinois, Maryland, or Washington State, you agree to bring any Claims, if at all, solely in arbitration before the American Arbitration Association in the city or county where our corporate headquarters are located.</p>

<p>23.3 Jury Waiver</p>

<p> In any trial between any of the parties as to any Claims, you and we agree to waive our rights to a jury trial and instead have such action tried by a judge.</p>

<p>23.4 Class Action Waiver</p>

<p> You agree to bring any Claims, if at all, individually and you shall not join such claim with claims of any other person or entity or bring, join or participate in a class action against us.</p>

<p>23.5 Limitation of Damages</p>

<p> Franchisee and Franchisor each waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any right or claim for any punitive or exemplary damages against the other and agree that if there is a dispute with the other, each will be limited to the recovery of actual damages sustained by it including reasonable accounting and legal fees as provided in Section 22.4. Franchisee waives and disclaims any right to consequential damages in any action or claim against Franchisor concerning this Agreement or any related agreement. In any claim or action brought by Franchisee against Franchisor concerning this Agreement, Franchisee&rsquo;s contract damages shall not exceed and shall be limited to refund of Franchisee&rsquo;s Franchise Fee and Royalty Fees.</p>

<p>23.6 Limitation of Actions  You agree to bring any Claims against us, if at all, within one (1) year of the occurrence of the facts giving rise to such Claims, and that any action not brought within this period shall be barred as a claim, counterclaim, defense, or set-off.</p>

<p>23.7 Prior Notice of Claims</p>

<p> As a condition precedent to commencing an action for a Claim, you must notify us within thirty (30) days after the occurrence of the violation or breach, and failure to timely give such notice shall preclude any claim for damages.</p>

<p>23.8 Internal Dispute Resolution</p>

<p> You must first bring any Claim to our CEO, after providing notice as in Section 23.7 above. You must exhaust this internal dispute resolution procedure before you may bring your Claim before a third party.</p>

<p>23.9 Mediation and Arbitration</p>

<p> Before you may bring any Claim against us, you agree to try for a period of 60 days to mediate such claim before a mutually agreed to mediator in the city or county where our headquarters are located. If we cannot mutually agree on a mediator, you and we agree to use the mediation services of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), and split any AAA and mediator fees equally.</p>

<p> If mediation is unsuccessful and you decide to pursue a legal claim against us, you agree to bring such claim solely in binding arbitration conducted in the city or county where our headquarters is located, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect.

<p> Title:   __ SCHEDULE 2 TO THE FRANCHISE AGREEMENT NONDISCLOSURE AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT</p>

<p> This &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo; made as of the  _ day of     _, 20 _, is by and between      , (&ldquo;Franchisee,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us,&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) and        (&ldquo;Individual,&rdquo; &ldquo;you,&rdquo; or &ldquo;your&rdquo;).</p>

<p>W I T N E S S E T H:</p>

<p> WHEREAS, Franchisee is a party to that certain Franchise Agreement dated      , 20__ (&ldquo;Franchise Agreement&rdquo;) by and between Franchisee and the Franchisor, Our Maids Franchise, Inc. (&ldquo;Company&rdquo;); and</p>

<p> WHEREAS, Franchisee desires Individual to have access to and review certain Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information, which are more particularly described below; and</p>

<p> WHEREAS, Franchisee is required by the Franchise Agreement to have Individual execute this Agreement prior to providing Individual access to said Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information; and   WHEREAS, Individual understands the necessity of not disclosing any such information to any other party or using such information to compete against Company, Franchisee or any other franchisee of Company in any business (i) that offers or provides (or grants franchises or licenses to others to operate a business that offers or provides) products and services the same as or similar to those provided by Franchisee or (ii) in which Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information (as defined below) could be used to the disadvantage of Franchisee, or Company, any affiliate of Company or Company&rsquo;s other franchisees (hereinafter, &ldquo;Competitive Business&rdquo;); provided, however, that the term &ldquo;Competitive Business&rdquo; shall not apply to any business operated by Franchisee under a Franchise Agreement with Company.</p>

<p> NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and undertakings stated here, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereby mutually agree as follows:</p>

<p> 1. Trade Secrets and Confidential Information</p>

<p> Individual understands Franchisee possesses and will possess Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information that are important to its business.</p>

<p> a) For the purposes of this Agreement, a &ldquo;Trade Secret&rdquo; is information in any form (including, but not limited to, materials and techniques, technical or non-technical data, formulas, patterns, recipes compilations, programs, devices, methods, techniques, drawings, processes, financial data, financial plans, product plans, passwords, lists of actual or potential customers or suppliers) related to or used in the Our Maids Business that is not commonly known by or available to the public and that information: (i) derives economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (ii) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.</p>

<p> b) For the purposes of this Agreement &ldquo;Confidential Information&rdquo; means technical and non-technical information used in or related to Our Maids that is not commonly known by or available to the public, including, without limitation, Trade Secrets and information contained in the Operations Manual and training guides and materials. In addition, any other information identified as confidential when delivered by Franchisee shall be deemed Confidential Information. Confidential Information shall not include, however, any information that: (i) is now or subsequently becomes generally available to the public through no fault of Individual; (ii) Individual can demonstrate was rightfully in its possession, without obligation of nondisclosure, prior to disclosure according to this Agreement; (iii) is independently developed without the use of any Confidential Information; or (iv) is rightfully obtained from a third party who has the right, without obligation of nondisclosure, to transfer or disclose such information.</p>

<p> c) Any information expressly designated by Company or Franchisee as &ldquo;Trade Secrets&rdquo; or &ldquo;Confidential Information&rdquo; shall be deemed such for all purposes of this Agreement, but the absence of designation shall not relieve Individual of his or her obligations hereunder in respect of information otherwise constituting Trade Secrets or Confidential Information. Individual understands Franchisee&rsquo;s providing of access to the Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information creates a relationship of confidence and trust between Individual and Franchisee with respect to the Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information.</p>

<p> 2. Confidentiality/Non-Disclosure</p>

<p> a) Individual shall not communicate or divulge to (or use for the benefit of) any other person, firm, association, or corporation, with the sole exception of Franchisee, now or at any time in the future, any Trade Secrets or other Confidential Information. At all times from the date of this Agreement, Individual must take all steps reasonably necessary and/or requested by Franchisee to ensure that the Confidential Information and Trade Secrets are kept confidential according to the terms of this Agreement. Individual must comply with all applicable policies, procedures and practices that Franchisee has established and may establish from time to time with regard to the Confidential Information and Trade Secrets.</p>

<p> b) Individual&rsquo;s obligations under paragraph 2(a) of this Agreement shall continue in effect after termination of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee, regardless of the reason or reasons for termination, and whether such termination is voluntary or involuntary, and Franchisee is entitled to communicate Individual&rsquo;s obligations under this Agreement to any future customer or employer to the extent deemed necessary by Franchisee for protection of its rights hereunder and regardless of whether Individual or any of its affiliates or assigns becomes an investor, partner, joint venturer, broker, distributor or the like in an Our Maids Business.</p>

<p> 3. Non-Competition</p>

<p> a) During the term of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee and for a period of two (2) years after the expiration or termination of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee, regardless of the cause of expiration or termination, Individual shall not, directly or indirectly, divert or attempt to divert any business or customer of Franchisee or the Company to any Competitive Business, by direct or indirect inducement or otherwise, or do or perform, directly or indirectly, any other act injurious or prejudicial to the goodwill associated with the Company&rsquo;s service mark &ldquo;Our Maids&rdquo; and such other trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, designs, graphics, logos, emblems, insignia, fascia, slogans, drawings and other commercial symbols as the Company designates to be used in connection with Our Maids or the Company&rsquo;s uniform standards, methods, procedures and specifications for the establishment and operation of an Our Maids business.     b) During the term of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, regardless of the cause of termination, Individual shall not, directly or indirectly, offer Competitive Business services anywhere within a TWENTY FIVE (25) mile radius of any Our Maids location without the express written consent of Franchisee and the Company.</p>

<p> c) During the term of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, regardless of the cause of termination, Individual shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit or otherwise attempt to induce or influence any business associate of Franchisee, Company or any other Our Maids Business to compete against, or terminate or modify his, her or its business relationship with, Franchisee, Company or any other Our Maids Business.</p>

<p> 4. Reasonableness of Restrictions</p>

<p> Individual acknowledges that each of the terms stated here, including the restrictive covenants, is fair and reasonable and is reasonably required for the protection of Franchisee, Company, and Company&rsquo;s Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information, the Company&rsquo;s business system, network of franchises and trade and service marks, and Individual waives any right to challenge these restrictions as being overly broad, unreasonable or otherwise unenforceable. If, however, a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any such restriction is unreasonable or unenforceable, then Individual shall submit to the reduction of any such activity, time period or geographic restriction necessary to enable the court to enforce such restrictions to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. It is the desire and intent of the parties that the provisions of this Agreement shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies applied in any jurisdiction where enforcement is sought.</p>

<p> 5. Relief for Breaches of Confidentiality, Non-Solicitation, and Non-Competition</p>

<p> Individual further acknowledges that an actual or threatened violation of the covenants contained in this Agreement will cause Franchisee and Company immediate and irreparable harm, damage and injury that cannot be fully compensated for by an award of damages or other remedies at law. Accordingly, Franchisee and/or Company shall be entitled, as a matter of right, to an injunction from any court of competent jurisdiction restraining any further violation by Individual of this Agreement without any requirement to show any actual damage or to post any bond or other security. Such right to an injunction shall be cumulative and in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights and remedies that Franchisee and Company may have at law or in equity.</p>

<p> 6. Dispute Resolution</p>

<p> a) Choice of Law. Except as to claims governed by federal law, the local law where the Franchised Business is located governs all claims that in any way relate to or arise out of this Agreement or any of the dealings of the parties (&ldquo;Claims&rdquo;). However, no laws regulating the sale of franchises or governing the relationship between franchisor and franchisee shall apply unless the jurisdictional requirements of such laws are met independently of this paragraph.</p>

<p> b) Jurisdiction and Venue. You and we agree that venue and jurisdiction for any Claims, except those required to be submitted to arbitration, shall be proper solely in the state and federal court nearest to our corporate headquarters.</p>

<p> c) Jury Waiver. In any trial between any of the parties as to any Claims, you and we agree to waive our rights to a jury trial and instead have such action tried by a judge.</p>

<p> d) Class Action Waiver. You agree to bring any Claims, if at all, individually and you shall not join such claim with claims of any other person or entity or bring, join or participate in a class action against us.  e) Punitive Damages Waiver. As to any Claims, you and we agree to waive our rights, if any, to seek or recover punitive damages.</p>

<p> f) Limitation of Actions. You agree to bring any Claims against us, if at all, within one (1) year of the occurrence of the facts giving rise to such Claims, and that any action not brought within this period shall be barred as a claim, counterclaim, defense, or set-off.</p>

<p>g) Prior Notice of Claims. As a condition precedent to commencing an action for a Claim, you must notify us within thirty (30) days after the occurrence of the violation or breach, and failure to timely give such notice shall preclude any claim for damages.</p>

<p>h) Internal Dispute Resolution. You must first bring any Claim to our CEO, after providing notice as in Section 6(g) above. You must exhaust this internal dispute resolution procedure before you may bring your Claim before a third party.</p>

<p> i) Mediation and Arbitration. Before you may bring any Claim against us court, you agree to try for a period of 60 days to mediate such claim before a mutually agreed to mediator in the city or county where our headquarters are located. If we cannot mutually agree on a mediator, you and we agree to use the mediation services of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), and split any AAA and mediator fees equally.</p>

<p> If mediation is unsuccessful and you decide to pursue a legal claim against us, you agree to bring such claim solely in binding arbitration conducted in the city or county of our headquarters in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. The proceedings will be held by a single arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding upon the parties. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having personal and subject matter jurisdiction.</p>

<p>j) Waiver of Bond. You agree that if we are forced to bring suit to enforce any provision of this Agreement, you agree to waive any requirement that we post bond to obtain a temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunction to enforce these duties.</p>

<p>k) Attorney Fees. If we are the substantially prevailing party as to any Claims, you agree to reimburse our costs and attorney fees incurred in pursuing or defending the Claims.</p>

<p>1. Use. Tenant is a franchisee of Franchisor. The Leased Premises shall be used only for the operation of an Our Maids business (or any name authorized by Franchisor).</p>

<p>2. Notice of Default and Opportunity To Cure. Landlord shall provide Franchisor with copies of any written notice of default (&ldquo;Default&rdquo;) given to Tenant under the Lease, and Landlord grants to Franchisor the option (but not the obligation) to cure any Default under the Lease (should Tenant fail to do so) within 10 days after the expiration of the period in which Tenant may cure the Default.</p>

<p>3. Termination of Lease. Landlord shall copy Franchisor on any notice of termination of the Lease. If Landlord terminates the Lease for Tenant&rsquo;s Default, Franchisor shall have the option to enter into a new Lease with Landlord on the same terms and conditions as the terminated Lease, subject to Landlord&rsquo;s approval in its reasonable discretion. To exercise this option, Franchisor must notify Landlord within 10 days after Franchisor receives notice of the termination of the Lease.</p>

<p>4. Termination of Franchise Agreement. If the Franchise Agreement between Franchisor and Tenant is terminated during the term of the Lease, then upon the written request of Franchisor, Landlord and Tenant consent to allow Franchisor to assume any existing term of the Lease (the &ldquo;Assumption&rdquo;), provided that any and all defaults have been cured and all payments due under the Lease are current, and to enter into a written agreement providing for such Assumption. In the event of an Assumption, Landlord will deliver possession of the Leased Premises to Franchisor free and clear of any rights of the Tenant or any third party. Landlord further consents to give Franchisor the right, following the Assumption, to assign its interest in the Lease or to sublet the Leased Premises to another franchisee of Franchisor with reasonable consent from the Landlord.</p>

<p>5. Assignment and Subletting. Notwithstanding any provision of the Lease to the contrary, Tenant shall have the right to assign or sublet the Lease to Franchisor, provided that no such assignment or sublease shall relieve Tenant or any guarantor of liability under the Lease. If Franchisor becomes the lessee of the Leased Premises, then Franchisor shall have the right to assign or sublease its lease to a franchisee of Franchisor&rsquo;s brand, subject to Landlord&rsquo;s approval in its reasonable discretion.</p>

<p>6. Authorization. Tenant authorizes Landlord and Franchisor to communicate directly with each other about Tenant and Tenant&rsquo;s business.</p>

<p>7. Right to Enter. Upon the expiration or termination of the Franchise Agreement or the Lease, or the termination of Tenant&rsquo;s right of possession of the Leased Premises, Franchisor or its designee may, after giving reasonable prior notice to Landlord, enter the Leased Premises within 10 days of such expiration or termination, to take any such actions as may be consistent with its rights under this Lease Addendum or to remove signs and other material bearing Franchisor&rsquo;s brand name, trademarks, and commercial symbols.</p>

<p>8. No Liability. By executing this Addendum, Franchisor does not assume any liability with respect to the Leased Premises or any obligation as Tenant under the Lease.</p>

<p> 1. Any claims arising under the Maryland Franchise Registration and Disclosure Law must be brought within 3 years after the grant of the franchise.</p>

<p> 2. A general release required as a condition of renewal, sale, and/or assignment/transfer shall not apply to any liability under the Maryland Franchise Registration and Disclosure Law.</p>

<p>If any of the terms of the Franchise Agreement are inconsistent with the terms below, the terms below control.</p>

<p>Minn. Stat. &sect;80C.21 and Minn. Rule 2860.4400(J) prohibit the franchisor from requiring litigation to be conducted outside Minnesota, requiring waiver of a jury trial, or requiring the franchisee to consent to liquidated damages, termination penalties or judgment notes. In addition, nothing in the Franchise Disclosure Document or agreements can abrogate or reduce (1) any of the franchisee&rsquo;s rights as provided for in Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 80C, or (2) franchisee&rsquo;s rights to any procedure, forum, or remedies provided for by the laws of the jurisdiction.</p>

<p>With respect to franchises governed by Minnesota law, the franchisor will comply with Minn. Stat. Sec. 80C.14 Subds. 3, 4, and 5 which require (except in certain specified cases), that a franchisee be given 90 days&rsquo; notice of termination (with 60 days to cure) and 180 days&rsquo; notice for non-renewal of the franchise agreement and that consent to the transfer of the franchise will not be unreasonably withheld.</p>

<p>Minnesota considers it unfair to not protect the franchisee&rsquo;s right to use the trademarks. Refer to Minnesota Statutes 80C.12, Subd. 1(g).</p>

<p>Minnesota Rules 2860.4400(D) prohibits a franchisor from requiring a franchisee to assent to a general release.</p>

<p>The franchisee cannot consent to the franchisor obtaining injunctive relief. The franchisor may seek injunctive relief. See Minn. Rules 2860.4400J.</p>

<p>Also, a court will determine if a bond is required.</p>

<p>Any Limitations of Claims section must comply with Minnesota Statutes, Section 80C.17, Subd. 5.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON ADDENDUM TO THE FRANCHISE AGREEMENT</p>

<p>If any of the terms of the Franchise Agreement are inconsistent with the terms below, the terms below control.</p>

<p>In the event of a conflict of laws, the provisions of the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, Chapter 19.100 RCW will prevail.</p>

<p>RCW 19.100.180 may supersede the franchise agreement in your relationship with the franchisor including the areas of termination and renewal of your franchise. There may also be court decisions which may supersede the franchise agreement in your relationship with the franchisor including the areas of termination and renewal of your franchise.</p>

<p>In any arbitration or mediation involving a franchise purchased in Washington, the arbitration or mediation site will be either in the state of Washington, or in a place mutually agreed upon at the time of the arbitration or mediation, or as determined by the arbitrator or mediator at the time of arbitration or mediation. In addition, if litigation is not precluded by the franchise agreement, a franchisee may bring an action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with the sale of franchises, or a violation of the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, in Washington.</p>

<p>A release or waiver of rights executed by a franchisee may not include rights under the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act or any rule or order thereunder except when executed pursuant to a negotiated settlement after the agreement is in effect and where the parties are represented by independent counsel. Provisions such as those which unreasonably restrict or limit the statute of limitations period for claims under the Act, or rights or remedies under the Act such as a right to a jury trial, may not be enforceable.</p>

<p>Transfer fees are collectable to the extent that they reflect the franchisor&rsquo;s reasonable estimated or actual costs in effecting a transfer.</p>

<p>Pursuant to RCW 49.62.020, a noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable against an employee, including an employee of a franchisee, unless the employee&rsquo;s earnings from the party seeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed $100,000 per year (an amount that will be adjusted annually for inflation). In addition, a noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable against an independent contractor of a franchisee under RCW 49.62.030 unless the independent contractor&rsquo;s earnings from the party seeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed $250,000 per year (an amount that will be adjusted annually for inflation). As a result, any provisions contained in the franchise agreement or elsewhere that conflict with these limitations are void and unenforceable in Washington.</p>

<p>RCW 49.62.060 prohibits a franchisor from restricting, restraining, or prohibiting a franchisee from (i) soliciting or hiring any employee of a franchisee of the same franchisor or (ii) soliciting or hiring any employee of the franchisor. As a result, any such provisions contained in the franchise agreement or elsewhere are void and unenforceable in Washington.</p>

<p>Section 17.2.2(a) is modified to also provide that the post-term non-compete will only apply to a 25 mile radius of your Franchised Business.</p>

<p>Section 21.3 is modified to also provide that the indemnification does not extend to liabilities resulting from the gross negligence of willful misconduct of any Franchisor indemnitee.</p>

<p> MINNESOTA ADDENDUM TO THE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT</p>

<p>As to franchises governed by the Minnesota franchise laws, if any of the terms of the Disclosure Document are inconsistent with the terms below, the terms below control.</p>

<p>Minn. Stat. &sect;80C.21 and Minn. Rule 2860.4400(J) prohibit the franchisor from requiring litigation to be conducted outside Minnesota, requiring waiver of a jury trial, or requiring the franchisee to consent to liquidated damages, termination penalties or judgment notes. In addition, nothing in the Franchise Disclosure Document or agreements can abrogate or reduce (1) any of the franchisee&rsquo;s rights as provided for in Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 80C, or (2) franchisee&rsquo;s rights to any procedure, forum, or remedies provided for by the laws of the jurisdiction.</p>

<p>With respect to franchises governed by Minnesota law, the franchisor will comply with Minn. Stat. Sec. 80C.14 Subds. 3, 4, and 5 which require (except in certain specified cases), that a franchisee be given 90 days&rsquo; notice of termination (with 60 days to cure) and 180 days&rsquo; notice for non-renewal of the franchise agreement and that consent to the transfer of the franchise will not be unreasonably withheld.</p>

<p>Minnesota considers it unfair to not protect the franchisee&rsquo;s right to use the trademarks. Refer to Minnesota Statutes 80C.12, Subd. 1(g).</p>

<p>Minnesota Rules 2860.4400(D) prohibits a franchisor from requiring a franchisee to assent to a general release.</p>

<p>The franchisee cannot consent to the franchisor obtaining injunctive relief. The franchisor may seek injunctive relief. See Minn. Rules 2860.4400J.</p>

<p>2. The following is added at the end of Item 3:</p>

<p> D. No such party is subject to a currently effective injunctive or restrictive order or decree relating to the franchise, or under a Federal, State or Canadian franchise, securities, antitrust, trade regulation or trade practice law, resulting from a concluded or pending action or proceeding brought by a public agency, or is subject to any currently effective order of any national securities association or national securities exchange, as defined in the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, suspending or expelling such person from membership in such association or exchange; or is subject to a currently effective injunctive or restrictive order relating to any other business activity as a result of an action brought by a public agency or department, including, without limitation, actions affecting a license as a real estate broker or sales agent.</p>

<p> 3. The following is added to the end of the &ldquo;Summary&rdquo; sections of Item 17(c), titled &ldquo;Requirements for franchisee to renew or extend,&rdquo; and Item 17(m), entitled &ldquo;Conditions for franchisor approval of transfer&rdquo;:</p>

<p>However, to the extent required by applicable law, all rights you enjoy and any causes of action arising in your favor from the provisions of Article 33 of the General Business Law of the State of New York and the regulations issued thereunder shall remain in force; it being the intent of this proviso that the non-waiver provisions of General Business Law Sections 687.4 and 687.5 be satisfied.</p>

<p>4. The following language replaces the &ldquo;Summary&rdquo; section of Item 17(d), titled &ldquo;Termination by franchisee&rdquo;:</p>

Instead, the prevailing party in any enforcement action is entitled to recover all costs and expenses including attorney's fees. RHODE ISLAND ADDENDUM TO THE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT</p>

<p>Section 19-28.1-14 of the Rhode Island Franchise Investment Act prohibits a franchisee to be restricted in choice of jurisdiction or venue. To the extent any such restriction is purported to be required by us, it is void with respect to all franchisees governed under the laws of Rhode Island.</p>

<p>Item 17.w. of the Disclosure Document is revised to provide:</p>

<p>Rhode Island law applies.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON ADDENDUM TO THE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT</p>

<p>As to franchises governed by the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, if any of the terms of the Disclosure Document are inconsistent with the terms below, the terms below control.</p>

<p>In the event of a conflict of laws, the provisions of the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, Chapter 19.100 RCW will prevail.</p>

<p>RCW 19.100.180 may supersede the franchise agreement in your relationship with the franchisor including the areas of termination and renewal of your franchise. There may also be court decisions which may supersede the franchise agreement in your relationship with the franchisor including the areas of termination and renewal of your franchise.</p>

<p>In any arbitration or mediation involving a franchise purchased in Washington, the arbitration or mediation site will be either in the state of Washington, or in a place mutually agreed upon at the time of the arbitration or mediation, or as determined by the arbitrator or mediator at the time of arbitration or mediation. In addition, if litigation is not precluded by the franchise agreement, a franchisee may bring an action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with the sale of franchises, or a violation of the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, in Washington.</p>

<p>A release or waiver of rights executed by a franchisee may not include rights under the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act or any rule or order thereunder except when executed pursuant to a negotiated settlement after the agreement is in effect and where the parties are represented by independent counsel. Provisions such as those which unreasonably restrict or limit the statute of limitations period for claims under the Act, or rights or remedies under the Act such as a right to a jury trial, may not be enforceable.</p>

<p>Transfer fees are collectable to the extent that they reflect the franchisor&rsquo;s reasonable estimated or actual costs in effecting a transfer.</p>

<p>Pursuant to RCW 49.62.020, a noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable against an employee, including an employee of a franchisee, unless the employee&rsquo;s earnings from the party seeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed $100,000 per year (an amount that will be adjusted annually for inflation). In addition, a noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable against an independent contractor of a franchisee under RCW 49.62.030 unless the independent contractor&rsquo;s earnings from the party seeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed $250,000 per year (an amount that will be adjusted annually for inflation). As a result, any provisions contained in the franchise agreement or elsewhere that conflict with these limitations are void and unenforceable in Washington.</p>

<p>RCW 49.62.060 prohibits a franchisor from restricting, restraining, or prohibiting a franchisee from (i) soliciting or hiring any employee of a franchisee of the same franchisor or (ii) soliciting or hiring any employee of the franchisor. As a result, any such provisions contained in the franchise agreement or elsewhere are void and unenforceable in Washington.</p>

<p>A release or waiver of rights signed by the franchisee shall not include rights under the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act except when executed according to a negotiated settlement after the agreement is in effect and where the parties are represented by independent counsel. Provisions such as those that unreasonably restrict or limit the statute of limitations period for claims under the Act, rights or remedies under the Act such as a right to a jury trial may not be enforceable.</p>

<p>Item 17.r. is modified to also provide that the post-term non-compete will only apply to a 25 mile radius of your Franchised Business.</p>

<p></p>

<p> WISCONSIN ADDENDUM TO THE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT</p>

<p>As to franchises governed by the Wisconsin Fair Dealership Law, if any of the terms of the Disclosure Document are inconsistent with the terms below, the terms below control.</p>

<p>Item 17 is modified to also provide:</p>

<p>If the franchise agreement contains any provisions that conflict with the Wisconsin Fair Dealership Law, the provisions of this Addendum shall prevail to the extent of such conflict.</p>

<p>With respect to franchises governed by Wisconsin law, the Wisconsin Fair Dealership Law applies to most, if not all, franchise agreements and prohibits the termination, cancellation, non-renewal or the substantial change of the competitive circumstances of a dealership agreement without good cause. That Law further provides that 90 days&rsquo; prior written notice of a proposed termination, etc. must be given to the dealer. The dealer has 60 days to cure the deficiency and if the deficiency is cured, the notice is void.</p>

<p>How to Use This Franchise Disclosure Document</p>

<p>Here are some questions you may be asking about buying a franchise and tips on how to find more information:</p>

<p>What You Need To Know About Franchising Generally</p>

<p>Continuing responsibility to pay fees. You may have to pay royalties and other fees even if you are losing money.    Business model can change. The franchise agreement may allow the franchisor to change its manuals and business model without your consent. These changes may require you to make additional investments in your franchise business or may harm your franchise business.    Supplier restrictions. You may have to buy or lease items from the franchisor or a limited group of suppliers the franchisor designates. These items may be more expensive than similar items you could buy on your own.    Operating restrictions. The franchise agreement may prohibit you from operating a similar business during the term of the franchise. There are usually other restrictions. Some examples may include controlling your location, your access to customers, what you sell, how you market, and your hours of operation.    Competition from franchisor. Even if the franchise agreement grants you a territory, the franchisor may have the right to compete with you in your territory.    Renewal. Your franchise agreement may not permit you to renew. Even if it does, you may have to sign a new agreement with different terms and conditions in order to continue to operate your franchise business.    When your franchise ends. The franchise agreement may prohibit you from operating a similar business after your franchise ends even if you still have obligations to your landlord or other creditors.    Some States Require Registration   Your state may have a franchise law, or other law, that requires franchisors to register before offering or selling franchises in the state. Registration does not mean that the state recommends the franchise or has verified the information in this document. To find out if your state has a registration requirement, or to contact your state, use the agency information in Exhibit A.    Your state also may have laws that require special disclosures or amendments be made to your franchise agreement. If so, you should check the State Specific Addenda. See the Table of Contents for the location of the State Specific Addenda.  </p>

<p>Special Risks to Consider About This Franchise   Certain states require that the following risk(s) be highlighted:     1. Out-of-State Dispute Resolution. The franchise agreement requires you to resolve disputes with the franchisor by mediation, arbitration and/or litigation only in Delaware. Out-of-state mediation, arbitration, or litigation may force you to accept a less favorable settlement for disputes. It may also cost more to mediate, arbitrate, or litigate with the franchisor in Delaware than in your own state.</p>

<p> 2. Short Operating History. The franchisor is at an early stage of development and has a limited operating history. This franchise is likely to be a riskier investment than a franchise in a system with a longer operating history.</p>

<p> 3. Financial Condition. The Franchisor&rsquo;s financial condition as reflected in its financial statements (see Item 21) calls into question the Franchisor&rsquo;s financial ability to provide services and support to you.</p>

<p>Certain states may require other risks to be highlighted. Check the &ldquo;State Specific Addenda&rdquo; (if any) to see whether your state requires other risks to be highlighted.</p>

<p>MICHIGAN ADDENDUM TO THE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT</p>

<p>THE STATE OF MICHIGAN PROHIBITS CERTAIN UNFAIR PROVISIONS THAT ARE SOMETIMES IN FRANCHISE DOCUMENTS. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS ARE IN THESE FRANCHISE DOCUMENTS, THE PROVISIONS ARE VOID AND CANNOT BE ENFORCED AGAINST YOU:</p>

<p>(a) A prohibition on the right of a franchisee to join an association of franchisees.</p>

<p>(b) A requirement that a franchisee assent to a release, assignment, novation, waiver, or estoppel which deprives a franchisee of rights and protections provided in this act. This shall not preclude a franchisee, after entering into a franchise agreement, from settling any and all claims.</p>

<p>(c) A provision that permits a franchisor to terminate a franchise prior to the expiration of its term except for good cause. Good cause shall include the failure of the franchisee to comply with any lawful provision of the franchise agreement and to cure such failure after being given written notice thereof and a reasonable opportunity, which in no event need be more than 30 days, to cure such failure.</p>

<p>(d) A provision that permits a franchisor to refuse to renew a franchise without fairly compensating the franchisee by repurchase or other means for the fair market value at the time of expiration of the franchisee&rsquo;s inventory, supplies, equipment, fixtures, and furnishings. Personalized materials which have no value to the franchisor and inventory, supplies, equipment, fixtures, and furnishings not reasonably required in the conduct of the franchise business are not subject to compensation. This subsection applies only if: (i) The term of the franchise is less than 5 years and (ii) the franchisee is prohibited by the franchise or other agreement from continuing to conduct substantially the same business under another trademark, service mark, trade name, logo type, advertising, or other commercial symbol in the same area subsequent to the expiration of the franchise or the franchisee does not receive at least 6 months advance notice of franchisor&rsquo;s intent not to renew the franchise.</p>

<p>(e) A provision that permits the franchisor to refuse to renew a franchise on terms generally available to other franchisees of the same class or type under similar circumstances. This section does not require a renewal provision.</p>

<p>(f) A provision requiring that arbitration or litigation be conducted outside this state. This shall not preclude the franchisee from entering into an agreement, at the time of arbitration, to conduct arbitration at a location outside this state.</p>

<p>(g) A provision which permits a franchisor to refuse to permit a transfer of ownership of a franchise, except for good cause. This subdivision does not prevent a franchisor from exercising a right of first refusal to purchase the franchise. Good cause shall include, but is not limited to: (i) The failure of the proposed transferee to meet the franchisor&rsquo;s then current reasonable qualifications or standards; (ii) The fact that the proposed transferee is a competitor of the franchisor or subfranchisor; (iii) The unwillingness of the proposed transferee to agree in writing to comply with all lawful obligations; (iv) The failure of the franchisee or proposed transferee to pay any sums owing to the franchisor or to cure any default in the franchise agreement existing at the time of the proposed transfer.</p>

<p>(h) A provision that requires the franchisee to resell to the franchisor items that are not uniquely identified with the franchisor. This subdivision does not prohibit a provision that grants to a franchisor a right of first refusal to purchase the assets of a franchise on the same terms and conditions as a bona fide third party willing and able to purchase those assets, nor does this subdivision prohibit a provision that grants the franchisor the right to acquire the assets of a franchise for the market or appraised value of such assets if the franchisee has breached the lawful provisions of the franchise agreement and has failed to cure the breach in the manner provided in subdivision (c).</p>

<p>(i) A provision which permits the franchisor to directly or indirectly convey, assign, or otherwise transfer its obligation to fulfill contractual obligations to the franchisee unless provision has been made for providing the required contractual services.</p>

<p>THE FACT THAT THERE IS A NOTICE OF THIS OFFERING ON FILE WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOES NOT CONSTITUTE APPROVAL, RECOMMENDATION, OR ENDORSEMENT BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.</p>

<p>11Total- We do not offer financing directly or indirectly for any part of the initial investment.</p>

<p>B. AREA DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT</p>

<p></p>

<p>Note 1- The low-end comprises of the initial franchise fee of $20,000 plus the $20,000 for the additional two outlets ($10,000 x 2). The high-end comprises of the initial franchise fee of $20,000 plus the $50,000 for the additional four outlets ($10,000 x 4).</p>

<p>Note 2-The low-end comprises of the low-end estimate from the Item 7.A table, less the $20,000 initial franchise fee, as it is included in the Area Development Fee ($42,500 - $20,000 = $22,500). The high-end comprises of the high-end estimate from the Item 7.A table, less the $20,000 initial franchise fee, as it is included in the Area Development Fee ($55,250 - $20,000 = $35,250).</p>

<p>The estimates in this Chart 7(B) assume that you will be entering into an Area Development Agreement for the right to open and operate three to five Franchised Businesses within a Development Area and the cost of opening the first Franchised Business.</p>

<p>The Area Development Fee ranges from $40,000 to $60,000 for three to five territories, as explained in Item 5 above. The Area Development Fee includes the Initial Franchise Fee on the first territory purchased under the Development Agreement and one-half the Initial Franchise Fee on additional territories. You pay the remaining one-half of the Initial Franchise Fee on additional territories at the time you enter into Franchise Agreements for such territories.</p>

You will be responsible for all travel costs, room and board and employees&rsquo; salaries incurred in connection with its attendance at such training. (Section 8.4 of the Franchise Agreement).</p>

<p>ITEM 12. TERRITORY</p>

<p>The territory will be for a specific geographic region that we define and approve by radius, zip codes, natural, or political boundaries as set forth in the Franchise Agreement.</p>

<p>A territory will normally include an area of 200,000 households.</p>

<p>We would not normally have occasion to approve relocation of the franchised business because you will work from your home and a vehicle.</p>

<p>We would not normally grant to you approval to open an additional outlet within your territory, but may grant you additional franchise territories if we feel you have the time, energy, capital, and management structure to be able to successfully open and operate another territory.</p>

<p>We do not grant you options, rights of first refusal, or similar rights to acquire additional franchises.</p>

<p>You will receive an exclusive territory, meaning a geographic area within which we promise not to establish either a company-owned or franchised outlet selling the same or similar goods or services under the same or similar trademarks or service marks.</p>

<p>Continuation of your territorial rights does not depend on achieving a certain sales volume, market penetration, or other contingency, and we may not alter your franchise territory, even if there is a population increase in your territory.</p>

<p>We or an affiliate reserves the right to use other channels of distribution, such as the Internet, catalog sales, telemarketing, or other direct marketing sales, to solicit or accept orders within your territory using our principal trademarks, however, we would normally direct inquiries for services from within your territory to your outlet.</p>

<p>We or an affiliate also reserves the right to use other channels of distribution, such as the Internet, catalog sales, telemarketing, or other direct marketing sales, to make sales within your territory of products or services under trademarks different from the ones that you will use under the franchise agreement.</p>

<p>We are not obligated to pay compensation to you for soliciting or accepting orders from inside your territory.</p>

<p>You and other franchisees may not solicit (but may accept) orders from consumers outside of your territory, including through the use of other channels of distribution, such as the Internet, catalog sales, telemarketing, or other direct marketing, but you may engage in internet and social media marketing pursuant to our guidelines which such marketing may extend outside your territory. We also reserve the right to implement cross-territorial protocols and other guidelines applicable to such situations as group advertising buys by multiple franchisees which may extend into multiple territories, solicitation of orders of individuals who may reside in one territory, yet work in another, and other cross-territorial situations. You agree to abide by any such cross-territorial protocols.</p>

<p>Neither we nor an affiliate operates, franchises, or has plans to operate or franchise a business under a different trademark which such business sells or will sell goods or services similar to those you will offer, but we reserve the right to do so.</p>

<p>Area Developers:</p>

<p> Under the Area Development Agreement (the &ldquo;ADA&rdquo;), you will develop, open and operate multiple outlets within a defined Development Area (the &ldquo;Development Area&rdquo;). We determine the Development Area using the same criteria that we use in deciding the Territory for a Business.</p>

<p>ITEM 13. TRADEMARKS</p>

<p>The franchise agreement licenses to you the right to use the following principal trademarks (&ldquo;Marks&rdquo;) registered or applied for with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (&ldquo;USPTO&rdquo;):</p>

<p></p>

<p> We do not have a federal registration for our principal trademark. SERIAL/ REGISTRATION NO. 7036264: PRINCIPAL REGISTER: REGISTRATION DATE, APRIL 25, 2023.</p>

<p>There are no currently effective agreements that significantly limit our rights to use or license the use of our trademarks listed in this section.</p>

<p>There are no currently effective determinations of the USPTO, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, or any state trademark administrator or any court; or any pending infringement, opposition, or cancellation proceeding in which we unsuccessfully sought to prevent registration of a trademark in order to protect a trademark licensed by the franchisor. There is no pending material federal or state court litigation regarding our use or ownership rights in a trademark.</p>

<p>We know of no infringing or prior superior uses that could materially affect the use of the Marks.</p>

<p>You do not receive any rights to the Marks other than the right to use them in the operation of your Franchised Business. You must follow our rules when you use the Marks. You must use the Marks as the sole trade identification of the franchised business. You cannot use any Mark or portion of any Mark as part of any business entity name. You may not use any Mark in connection with the sale of any unauthorized services or products, or in any other manner that we do not authorize in writing. You must obtain a fictitious or assumed name registration if required by your state or local law. Any unauthorized use of the Marks by you is a breach of the Franchise Agreement and an infringement of our rights in the Marks. You must not contest the validity or ownership of the Marks, including any Marks that we license to you after you sign the Franchise Agreement. You must not assist any other person in contesting the validity or ownership of the Marks.</p>

<p>You must immediately notify us in writing when you learn about any claim of infringement, unfair competition, or similar claims about the Marks. You must not communicate with any person other than us and our counsel regarding any infringements, challenges or claims unless you are legally required to do so. However, you may communicate with your own counsel at your own expense. We are not required to take affirmative action when notified of these uses or claims. We have the sole right to control any administrative or judicial proceeding involving a trademark licensed by us. The Franchise Agreement does not require us to participate in your defense or indemnify you for expenses or damages if you are a party to an administrative or judicial proceeding involving a trademark licensed by us to you or if the proceeding is resolved unfavorable to you. You must take any actions that, in the opinion of our counsel, may be advisable to protect and maintain our interests in any proceeding or to otherwise protect and maintain our interests in the Marks.</p>

<p>If we require, you must modify or discontinue the use of any Mark and use other trademarks or service marks we designate. We do not have to reimburse you for modifying or discontinuing the use of a Mark or for substituting another trademark or service mark for a discontinued Mark. If we adopt and use new or modified Marks, you must add or replace equipment, supplies and fixtures, and you must make other modifications we designate as necessary to adapt your franchised business for the new or modified Marks. We do not reimburse you for any loss of goodwill associated with a modified or discontinued Mark.</p>

<p>You must notify us if you apply for your own trademark or service mark registrations. You must not register or seek to register as a trademark or service mark, either with the USPTO or any state or foreign country, any of the Marks or a trademark or service mark that is confusingly similar to any of our Marks.</p>

<p>ITEM 14. PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION</p>

<p>No patents or pending patent applications are material to the franchise. We own copyrights in the Operations Manual, our website, our marketing materials, training manuals or videos, and other copyrightable items that are part of the System. While we claim copyrights in these and similar items, we have not registered these copyrights with the United States Register of Copyrights. You may use these items only as we specify while operating the Franchised Business and you must stop using them if we direct you to do so.</p>

<p>We do not have an obligation to protect the copyrights or to defend you against claims arising from your use of the copyrighted items. You must notify us if any claim for copyright infringement is brought against you over materials in which we claim a copyright. We have the right to control litigation over our copyrights. We are not required to participate in your defense or indemnify you for expenses and damages in a proceeding involving a copyright licensed to you. Your rights in the franchise agreement would continue if we require you to modify or discontinue using the subject matter covered by the copyright.</p>

<p>We know of no effective determinations of the U.S. Copyright Office or any court regarding any of our copyrighted materials. Our right to use or license copyrighted items is not materially limited by any agreement or known infringing use.</p>

<p>We have developed certain trade secrets and other confidential information, including methods of business management, sales and promotion techniques, and know-how, knowledge of, and experience in, operating an Our Maids Business. We will provide our trade secrets and other confidential information to you during training, in the Operations Manual and as a result of the assistance we furnish you during the term of the franchise. You may only use the trade secrets and other confidential information for the purpose of operating your Franchised Business. You may only divulge trade secrets and/or other confidential information to employees who must have access to it to operate the Franchised Business. You are responsible for enforcing the confidentiality provisions as to your employees.</p>

<p>Certain individuals with access to trade secrets or other confidential information, including your shareholders, officers, directors, partners, members, if you are a corporation, limited liability company or other business entity, and your managers, executives, employees and staff may be required to sign nondisclosure and non-competition agreements in a form the same as or similar to the Nondisclosure and Non-Competition Agreement attached to the Franchise Agreement. We will be a third-party beneficiary with the right to enforce those agreements.</p>

<p>All ideas, concepts, techniques or materials concerning the franchised business and/or the System, whether or not protectable intellectual property and whether created by or for you or your owners or employees, must be promptly disclosed to us and will be deemed our sole and exclusive property and a part of the System that we may choose to adopt and/or disclose to other franchisees, and you agree to assign to us all right, title and interest in any intellectual property so developed without additional compensation to you. Likewise, we will disclose to you concepts and developments of other franchisees that we make part of the System. You must also assist us in obtaining intellectual property rights in any concept or development if requested.</p>

<p>Your use of the Operations Manual, trade secrets or other confidential information in an unauthorized manner is a default of the Franchise Agreement that may result in automatic termination of the Franchise Agreement. Further information about termination of the Franchise Agreement following a default is included in Item 17.</p>

<p>ITEM 15. OBLIGATION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ACTUAL OPERATION OF THE FRANCHISE BUSINESS</p>

<p>Either the Franchisee or its on-site Designated Manager must devote sufficient efforts to the management of the day-to-day operations of the Franchised Business, but not less than forty (40) hours per week. While you have the right to select any Designated Manager, we retain the right to accept or reject any proposed individual or entity as the Designated Manager. You will be responsible for the compensation to any individual or entity you contract to act as the Designated Manager of the Business. You have the sole legal responsibility for any dispute relating to such individual or entity. We maintain the right to require any approved Designated Manager to attend and satisfactorily complete our initial training program before opening the Business. You must keep us informed at all times of the identity of your Designated Manager. If you must replace the Designated Manager, your replacement Manager must be approved by us within 60 days, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld &ndash; we may additionally require such replacement Designated Manager to attend and complete our training program at your expense. If the Franchisee is an entity, its Designated Manager is not required to own an equity interest in the Franchisee.</p>

<p>As described in ITEM 14, certain individuals associated with your Franchised Business, including your owners, officers, directors, partners, and your managers, executives, employees, and staff may be required to sign nondisclosure and non-competition agreements the same as or similar to the Nondisclosure and Non-Competition Agreement attached to the Franchise Agreement. We will be a third-party beneficiary with the independent right to enforce the agreements.</p>

<p>If you are a corporation or other business entity, anyone who owns a 5% or greater interest in the entity must personally guarantee the performance of all of your obligations under the Franchise Agreement and agree to be personally liable for your breach of the Franchise Agreement by signing the Unlimited Guaranty and Assumption of Obligations attached to the Franchise Agreement.</p>

<p>ITEM 16. RESTRICTIONS ON WHAT THE FRANCHISEE MAY SELL</p>

<p>You must offer and sell all the services and products we specify. You may not sell any services or products that we have not authorized and you must discontinue offering any services or products that we may disapprove of. We may take action, including terminating your franchise if you purchase or sell unapproved products or make purchases from unapproved suppliers. We may periodically change required or authorized services or products. There are no limits on our right to do so, except that your investment required to change required or authorized products or services will not be unreasonably disproportionate to your initial investment.</p>

<p>Periodically, we may allow certain services or products that are not otherwise authorized for general use as a part of the System to be offered locally or regionally based on factors, including test marketing, your qualifications, and regional or local differences.</p>

<p> We do not place restrictions on you with respect to who may be a customer of your Franchised Business.</p>

Accordingly, Franchisee shall provide or offer for sale or use at the Franchised Business only those services, with the greatest diligence and care by Franchisee, that Franchisor approves (and which are not thereafter disapproved) and that comply with Franchisor&rsquo;s specifications and quality standards. If required by Franchisor, any such items or services shall be purchased only from Franchisor.

If Franchisor or an Affiliate is an Approved Supplier, Franchisee shall execute a standard form purchase or supply agreement for the items to be supplied by Franchisor or its Affiliate. If Franchisee desires to utilize any products, services or new technology that Franchisor has not approved (for products and services that require supplier approval), Franchisee shall first send Franchisor sufficient information, specifications and samples for Franchisor to determine whether the service or product complies with its standards and specifications or whether the supplier meets its Approved Supplier criteria.

Franchisor will decide within a reasonable time (usually thirty [30] days) after receiving the required information whether Franchisee may purchase or lease such items or services or from such supplier. Approval of a supplier may be conditioned on the supplier&rsquo;s ability to provide sufficient quantity of product; quality of products or services at competitive prices; production and delivery capability; and dependability and general reputation.

This Section is not intended as an approval of Franchisee&rsquo;s right to operate other businesses and in no way is it intended to contradict Sections 17, 17.1 or 17.2. Franchisee shall make such modifications or alterations to the Franchised Business (including changing telephone and facsimile numbers) immediately upon termination or expiration of this Agreement as may be necessary to prevent any association between Franchisor or the System and any business subsequently operated by Franchisee or others at the Franchised Business. Franchisee shall make such specific additional changes to the Franchised Business as Franchisor may reasonably request for that purpose including, without limitation, removal of all physical and structural features identifying or distinctive to the System. If Franchisee fails or refuses to comply with the requirements of this Section, Franchisor has the right to enter upon the Franchised Business for the purpose of making or causing to be made such changes as may be required, at the expense of Franchisee, which expense Franchisee shall pay upon demand.</p>

<p>17.4 Franchisor&rsquo;s Option to Purchase Certain Business Assets</p>

<p> Franchisor has the right (but not the obligation), for a period of thirty (30) days after termination or expiration of this Agreement, to purchase any or all assets of the Franchised Business including improvements, vehicles, service tools and equipment, supplies and other inventory or equipment. The purchase price shall be equal to the assets&rsquo; book value. If Franchisor elects to exercise this option to purchase, it has the right to set off all amounts due from Franchisee under this Agreement, if any, against the purchase price.</p>

<p>17.5 Survival of Certain Provisions</p>

<p> All obligations of Franchisor and Franchisee, which expressly or by their nature survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement, shall continue in full force and effect subsequent to and notwithstanding their expiration or termination and until satisfied or by their nature expire.</p>

<p>18. TRANSFERABILITY OF INTEREST</p>

<p>18.1 Transfer by Franchisor</p>

<p> This Agreement and all rights and duties hereunder are fully transferable in whole or in part by Franchisor and such rights will inure to the benefit of any person or entity to whom transferred; provided, however, that with respect to any assignment resulting in the subsequent performance by the assignee of the functions of Franchisor, the assignee shall assume the obligations of Franchisor hereunder and Franchisor shall thereafter have no liability for the performance of any obligations contained in this Agreement.</p>

<p>18.2 Transfer by Franchisee to a Third Party</p>

<p> The rights and duties of Franchisee as in this Agreement, and the Franchise herein granted, are personal to Franchisee (or its owners), and Franchisor has entered into this Agreement in reliance upon Franchisee&rsquo;s personal or collective skill and financial ability. Accordingly, neither Franchisee nor any holder of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisee may sell, assign, convey, give away, pledge, mortgage, sublicense or otherwise transfer, whether by operation of law or otherwise, any interest in this Agreement, the Franchise granted hereby, the assets of the Franchised Business or any part or all of the ownership interest in Franchisee without the prior written approval of Franchisor. Any purported transfer without such approval shall be null and void and shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement. If Franchisee is in compliance with this Agreement, Franchisor&rsquo;s consent to such transfer shall be conditioned upon the satisfaction of the following requirements:</p>

<p>Franchisee has complied with the requirements in Section 19;</p>

<p>all obligations owed to Franchisor, and all other outstanding obligations relating to the Franchised Business, are fully paid and satisfied;</p>

<p>Franchisee (and any transferring owners, if Franchisee is a business entity) has executed a general release, in a form the same as or similar to the General Release attached as Schedule 1, of any and all claims against Franchisor, including its officers, directors, shareholders, managers, members, partners, owners, employees and agents (in their corporate and individual capacities), including, without limitation, claims arising under federal, state or local laws, rules or ordinances, and any other matters incident to the termination of this Agreement or to the transfer of Franchisee&rsquo;s interest herein or to the transfer of Franchisee&rsquo;s ownership of all or any part of the Franchise; provided, however, that if a general release is prohibited, Franchisee shall give the maximum release allowed by law;</p>

<p>the prospective transferee has satisfied Franchisor that it meets Franchisor&rsquo;s management, business and financial standards, and otherwise possesses the character and capabilities, including business reputation and credit rating, as Franchisor may require to demonstrate ability to conduct the Franchised Business;</p>

<p>the transferee and, if Franchisor requires, all persons owning any interest in the transferee, have executed the then-current franchise agreement for new franchisees, which may be substantially different from this Agreement, including different Royalty Fee and other material provisions, and the franchise agreement then executed shall be for the term specified in such agreement;</p>

<p>the transferee has executed a general release, in a form the same as or similar to the General Release attached as Schedule 1, of any and all claims against Franchisor and its officers, directors, shareholders, managers, members, partners, owners, employees and agents (in their corporate and individual capacities), with respect to any representations regarding the Franchise or the business conducted pursuant thereto or any other matter that may have been made to the transferee by Franchisee;</p>

<p>Franchisee has provided Franchisor with a complete copy of all contracts and agreements and related documentation between Franchisee and the prospective transferee relating to the intended sale or transfer of the Franchise;</p>

<p>Franchisee, or the transferee, has paid to Franchisor, before the transaction is completed, a transfer fee in the amount of 25% of the then current initial franchise fee;</p>

<p>the transferee, or all holders of a legal or beneficial interest in the transferee, has agreed to be personally bound jointly and severally by all provisions of this Agreement for the remainder of its term by executing a personal guaranty in such form as prepared by Franchisor;</p>

<p>the transferee has obtained all necessary consents and approvals by third parties and all applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules, ordinances, and requirements applicable to the transfer have been complied with or satisfied;</p>

<p>Franchisee has, and if Franchisee is an entity, all of the holders of a legal and beneficial interest in Franchisee have executed and delivered to Franchisor a nondisclosure and non-competition agreement in a form satisfactory to Franchisor and in substance the same as the nondisclosure and non-competition covenants contained in Sections 7 and 17; and</p>

<p>the transferee agrees that it shall complete, to Franchisor&rsquo;s satisfaction, a training program in substance similar to the initial training described in Section 8.1 prior to assuming the management of the day-to-day operation of the Franchised Business.</p>

<p>18.3 Transfer to a Controlled Entity</p>

<p> 18.3.1 If Franchisee wishes to transfer this Agreement or any interest herein to a corporation, limited liability company or other legal entity which shall be entirely owned by Franchisee (&ldquo;Controlled Entity&rdquo;), which Controlled Entity is being formed for the financial planning, tax or other convenience of Franchisee, Franchisor&rsquo;s consent to such transfer shall be conditioned upon the satisfaction of the following requirements:</p>

<p>the Controlled Entity is newly organized and its charter or articles of formation provides that its activities are confined exclusively to the operation of the Franchised Business;</p>

<p>Franchisee or all holders of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisee own all of the equity and voting power of the outstanding stock or other capital interest in the Controlled Entity;</p>

<p>all obligations of Franchisee to Franchisor or any Affiliate are fully paid and satisfied; provided, however, that neither Franchisee nor the Controlled Entity shall be required to pay a transfer fee as required according to Section 18.2(h);</p>

<p>the Controlled Entity has entered into a written agreement with Franchisor expressly assuming the obligations of this Agreement and all other agreements relating to the operation of the Franchised Business. If the consent of any other party to any such other agreement is required, Franchisee has obtained such written consent and provided the same to Franchisor prior to consent by Franchisor;</p>

<p>all holders of a legal or beneficial interest in the Controlled Entity have entered into an agreement with Franchisor jointly and severally guaranteeing the full payment of the Controlled Entity&rsquo;s obligations to Franchisor and the performance by the Controlled Entity of all the obligations of this Agreement;</p>

<p>each stock certificate or other ownership interest certificate of the Controlled Entity has conspicuously endorsed upon the face thereof a statement in a form satisfactory to Franchisor that it is held subject to, and that further assignment or transfer thereof is subject to, all restrictions imposed upon transfers and assignments by this Agreement; and</p>

<p>copies of the Controlled Entity&rsquo;s articles of incorporation or organization, bylaws, operating agreement, federal tax identification number, and other governing regulations or documents, including resolutions of the board of directors authorizing entry into this Agreement, have been promptly furnished to Franchisor. Any amendment to any such documents shall also be furnished to Franchisor immediately upon adoption.</p>

<p> 18.3.2 The term of the transferred franchise shall be the unexpired term of this Agreement, including all renewal rights, subject to any and all conditions applicable to such renewal rights.</p>

<p> 18.3.3 Franchisor&rsquo;s consent to a transfer of any interest in this Agreement, or of any ownership interest in the Franchised Business, shall not constitute a waiver of any claims Franchisor may have against the transferor or the transferee, nor shall it be deemed a waiver of Franchisor&rsquo;s right to demand compliance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>

<p>18.4 Franchisor&rsquo;s Disclosure to Transferee</p>

<p> Franchisor has the right, without liability of any kind or nature whatsoever to Franchisee, to make available for inspection by any intended transferee of Franchisee all or any part of Franchisor&rsquo;s records relating to this Agreement, the Franchised Business or to the history of the relationship of the parties hereto. Franchisee hereby specifically consents to such disclosure by Franchisor and shall release and hold Franchisor harmless from and against any claim, loss or injury resulting from an inspection of Franchisor&rsquo;s records relating to the Franchised Business by an intended transferee identified by Franchisee.</p>

<p>18.5 For-Sale Advertising</p>

<p> Franchisee shall NOT, without prior written consent of Franchisor, place in, on or upon the area of the Franchised Business, or in any communication media, any form of advertising relating to the sale of the Franchised Business or the rights granted hereunder.</p>

<p>18.6 Transfer by Death or Incapacity</p>

<p> Upon the death or Incapacity of Franchisee (if Franchisee is an individual) or any holder of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisee (if Franchisee is a business entity), the appropriate representative of such person (whether administrator, personal representative or trustee) shall, within a reasonable time not exceeding one hundred eighty (180) days following such event, transfer such individual&rsquo;s interest in the Franchised Business or in Franchisee to a third party approved by Franchisor. Such transfers, including transfers by will or inheritance, shall be subject to the conditions for assignments and transfers contained in this Agreement. During such one hundred eighty (180) day period, the Franchised Business must remain at all times under the primary management of a Designated Manager who otherwise meets Franchisor&rsquo;s management qualifications.</p>

<p> Following such a death or Incapacity of such person as described in this Section 18.6, if necessary in Franchisor&rsquo;s discretion, Franchisor shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assume operation of the Franchised Business until the deceased or incapacitated owner&rsquo;s interest is transferred to a third party approved by Franchisor. Franchisor shall be given access to the Franchised Business, even if located within Franchisee&rsquo;s or its Designated Manager&rsquo;s principal residence, and shall not be held liable for trespass or any related tort. Franchisor may charge a management fee as stated in the Operations Manual from time to time, currently equal to $250 per person per day, and Franchisor shall be entitled to reimbursement of any expenses Franchisor incurs that are not paid out of the operating cash flow of the Franchised Business.</p>

<p>19. RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL</p>

<p>19.1 Submission of Offer</p>

<p> If Franchisee, or any of its owners, proposes to sell or otherwise transfer (including a transfer by death or Incapacity according to Section 18.6) the Franchised Business (or any of its assets outside of the normal course of business), any ownership interest in Franchisee or any ownership interest in the Franchise granted hereunder, Franchisee shall obtain and deliver a bona fide, executed written offer or proposal to purchase, along with all pertinent documents including any contract or due diligence materials, to Franchisor, except with regards to a sale or transfer to a family member. The offer must apply only to an approved sale of the assets or interests listed above and may not include any other property or rights of Franchisee or any of its owners.</p>

<p>19.2 Franchisor&rsquo;s Right to Purchase</p>

<p> Franchisor shall, for thirty (30) days from the date of delivery of all such documents, have the right, exercisable by written notice to Franchisee, to purchase the offered assets or interest for the price and on the same terms and conditions contained in such offer communicated to Franchisee. Franchisor has the right to substitute cash for the fair market value of any form of payment proposed in such offer. Franchisor&rsquo;s credit shall be deemed at least equal to the credit of any proposed buyer. After providing notice to Franchisee of Franchisor&rsquo;s intent to exercise this right of first refusal, Franchisor shall have up to sixty (60) days to close the purchase. Franchisor shall be entitled to receive from Franchisee all customary representations and warranties given by Franchisee as the seller of the assets or such ownership interest or, at Franchisor&rsquo;s election, such representations and warranties contained in the proposal.</p>

<p>19.3 Non-Exercise of Right of First Refusal</p>

<p> If Franchisor does not exercise its right of first refusal within thirty (30) days from the date of delivery of all such documents, the offer or proposal may be accepted by Franchisee or any of its owners, subject to Franchisor&rsquo;s prior written approval as required by Section 18.2. Should the sale fail to close within 120 days after the offer is delivered to Franchisor, Franchisor&rsquo;s right of first refusal shall renew and be implemented in accordance with this Section.</p>

<p>19.4 Sales or Transfers to Family Excepted</p>

<p> If Franchisee proposes to sell or otherwise transfer the Franchised Business (or any of its assets outside of the normal course of business), any ownership interest in Franchisee or any ownership interest in the Franchise granted hereunder to a member of Franchisee&rsquo;s (or its owners&rsquo;) family, then the terms and conditions of this Section shall be inapplicable. Nothing in this Section 19.4 shall be construed to relieve Franchisee from full compliance with the terms and conditions of Section 18.2 prior to a sale or transfer to family according to this Section.</p>

<p>20. BENEFICIAL OWNERS OF FRANCHISEE</p>

<p> Franchisee represents, and Franchisor enters into this Agreement in reliance upon such representation, that the individual(s) identified in Schedule 6 is/are the sole holder(s) of a legal or beneficial interest (in the stated percentages) of Franchisee.</p>

<p>21. RELATIONSHIP AND INDEMNIFICATION</p>

<p>21.1 Relationship</p>

<p> This Agreement is purely a contractual relationship between the parties and does not appoint or make Franchisee an agent, legal representative, joint-venturer, partner, employee, servant, or independent contractor of Franchisor for any purpose whatsoever. Franchisee may not represent or imply to third parties that Franchisee is an agent of Franchisor, and Franchisee is in no way authorized to make any contract, agreement, warranty, or representation on behalf of Franchisor, or to create any obligation, express or implied, on Franchisor&rsquo;s behalf. During the term of this Agreement, and any extension or renewal hereof, Franchisee shall hold itself out to the public only as a franchisee and an owner of the Franchised Business operating the Franchised Business according to a franchise from Franchisor. Franchisee shall take such affirmative action as may be necessary to do so including, without limitation, exhibiting a notice of that fact in a conspicuous place on all forms, stationery or other written materials, the content of which Franchisor has the right to specify. Under no circumstances shall Franchisor be liable for any act, omission, contract, debt, nor any other obligation of Franchisee. Franchisor shall in no way be responsible for any injuries to persons or property resulting from the operation of the Franchised Business by Franchisee. Any third-party contractors and vendors retained by Franchisee to convert or construct the premises are independent contractors of Franchisee alone.</p>

<p>21.2 Standard of Care</p>

<p> This Agreement does not establish a fiduciary relationship between the parties.</p>

<p>21.3 Indemnification</p>

<p> Franchisee shall hold harmless and indemnify Franchisor, any Affiliate, all holders of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisor and all officers, directors, executives, managers, members, partners, owners, employees, agents, successors and assigns (collectively &ldquo;Franchisor Indemnities&rdquo;) from and against all losses, damages, fines, costs, expenses or liability (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and all other costs of litigation) incurred in connection with any action, suit, demand, claim, investigation or proceeding, or any settlement thereof, which arises from or is based upon Franchisee&rsquo;s (a) ownership or operation of the Franchised Business; (b) violation, breach or asserted violation or breach of any federal, state or local law, regulation or rule; (c) breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or provision of this Agreement or any other agreement between Franchisee and Franchisor (or an Affiliate); (d) defamation of Franchisor or the System; (e) acts, errors or omissions committed or incurred in connection with the Franchised Business; or (f) infringement, violation or alleged infringement or violation of any Mark, patent or copyright or any misuse of the Trade Secrets or other Confidential Information. The obligations of this Section 21.3 shall expressly survive the termination of this Agreement.</p>

<p>21.4 Right to Retain Counsel</p>

<p> Franchisee shall give Franchisor immediate notice of any such action, suit, demand, claim, investigation, or proceeding that may give rise to a claim for indemnification by a Franchisor Indemnity. Franchisor has the right to retain counsel of its own choosing in connection with any such action, suit, demand, claim, investigation or proceeding. In order to protect persons, property, Franchisor&rsquo;s reputation or the goodwill of others, Franchisor has the right to, at any time without notice, take such remedial or corrective actions as it deems expedient with respect to any action, suit, demand, claim, investigation or proceeding if, in Franchisor&rsquo;s sole judgment, there are grounds to believe any of the acts or circumstances listed above have occurred. If Franchisor&rsquo;s exercise of its rights under this Section causes any of Franchisee&rsquo;s insurers to refuse to pay a third-party claim, all cause of action and legal remedies Franchisee might have against such insurer shall automatically be assigned to Franchisor without the need for any further action on either party&rsquo;s part. Under no circumstances shall Franchisor be required or obligated to seek coverage from third parties or otherwise mitigate losses in order to maintain a claim against Franchisee. The failure to pursue such remedy or mitigate such loss shall in no way reduce the amounts recoverable by Franchisor from Franchisee. Franchisee agrees to not be a party to class action suit against the Franchisor or any of its Affiliates under any circumstances.</p>

<p>22. GENERAL CONDITIONS AND PROVISIONS</p>

<p>22.1 No Waiver</p>

<p> No failure of Franchisor to exercise any power reserved to it hereunder, or to insist upon strict compliance by Franchisee with any obligation or condition hereunder, and no custom nor practice of the parties in variance with the terms hereof, shall constitute a waiver of Franchisor&rsquo;s right to demand exact compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Waiver by Franchisor of any particular default by Franchisee shall not be binding unless in writing and executed by Franchisor and shall not affect nor impair Franchisor&rsquo;s right with respect to any subsequent default of the same or of a different nature. Subsequent acceptance by Franchisor of any payment(s) due shall not be deemed to be a waiver by Franchisor of any preceding breach by Franchisee of any terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement.</p>

<p>22.2 Injunctive Relief</p>

<p> As any breach by Franchisee of any of the restrictions contained in Sections 6, 7, and 17 would result in irreparable injury to Franchisor, and as the damages arising out of any such breach would be difficult to ascertain, in addition to all other remedies provided by law or in equity, Franchisor shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief (whether a restraining order, a preliminary injunction or a permanent injunction) against any such breach, whether actual or contemplated, without the necessity of posting security or bond and Franchisee shall be responsible for Franchisor&rsquo;s reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees incurred in pursuing the same. Franchisor&rsquo;s right to seek injunctive relief will not affect the parties&rsquo; waiver of jury trial and covenant to arbitrate all disputes in accordance with Section 23.7. Franchisor&rsquo;s rights herein shall include pursuing injunctive relief through arbitration or in a state or federal court.</p>

<p>22.3 Notices</p>

<p> All notices required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed received: (a) at the time delivered by hand to the recipient party (or to an officer, director or partner of the recipient party); (b) on the next business day after transmission by facsimile or other reasonably reliable electronic communication system; (c) two (2) business days after being sent via guaranteed overnight delivery by a commercial courier service; or (d) five (5) business days after being sent by Registered Mail, return receipt requested. Either party may change its address by a written notice sent in accordance with this Section 22.3. All notices, payments and reports required by this Agreement shall be sent to Franchisor at the following address, or at such other address as Franchisor may provide:</p>

<p> Our Maids Franchise, Inc.  Attn.: Antonio Moreno  8 The Green, Suite 14095  Dover, DE 19901</p>

<p>22.4 Cost of Enforcement or Defense</p>

<p> If Franchisor is required to enforce this Agreement in a judicial or arbitration proceeding, if it is the prevailing party, it shall be entitled to reimbursement of its costs, including reasonable accounting and attorneys&rsquo; fees, in connection with such proceeding.</p>

<p>22.5 Unlimited Guaranty and Assumption of Obligations</p>

<p> All holders of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisee of five percent (5%) or greater shall be required to execute, as of the date of this Agreement, the Unlimited Guaranty and Assumption of Obligations attached as Schedule 3, through which such holders agree to assume and discharge all of Franchisee&rsquo;s obligations under this Agreement and to be personally liable hereunder for all of the same.</p>

<p>22.6 Approvals</p>

<p> Whenever this Agreement requires the prior approval or consent of Franchisor, Franchisee shall make a timely written request to Franchisor for such approval and, except as otherwise provided herein, any approval or consent granted shall be effective only if in writing. Franchisor makes no warranties or guarantees upon which Franchisee may rely, and assumes no liability or obligation to Franchisee or any third party to which it would not otherwise be subject, by providing any waiver, approval, advice, consent or services to Franchisee in connection with this Agreement, or by reason of any neglect, delay or denial of any request for approval.</p>

<p>22.7 Entire Agreement</p>

<p> This Agreement and all exhibits to this Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties and supersede any and all prior negotiations, understandings, representations, and agreements. Nothing in this or in any related agreement, however, is intended to disclaim the representations we made in the franchise disclosure document that we furnished to you. No amendment, change or variance from this Agreement shall be binding on either party unless executed in writing by both parties.</p>

<p>22.8 Severability and Modification</p>

<p> Except as noted below, each paragraph, part, term and provision of this Agreement shall be considered severable. If any paragraph, part, term or provision herein is ruled to be unenforceable, unreasonable or invalid, such ruling shall not impair the operation of or affect the remaining portions, paragraphs, parts, terms and provisions of this Agreement, and the latter shall continue to be given full force and effect and bind the parties; and such unenforceable, unreasonable or invalid paragraphs, parts, terms or provisions shall be deemed not part of this Agreement.</p>

<p> Notwithstanding the above, each of the covenants contained in Sections 7 and 17 shall be construed as independent of any other covenant or provision of this Agreement. If all or any portion of any such covenant is held to be unenforceable, unreasonable, or invalid, then it shall be amended to provide for limitations on disclosure of Trade Secrets or other Confidential Information or on competition to the maximum extent provided or permitted by law.</p>

<p>22.9 Construction</p>

<p> All captions herein are intended solely for the convenience of the parties, and none shall be deemed to affect the meaning or construction of any provision hereof.</p>

<p>22.10 Force Majeure</p>

<p> Whenever a period of time is provided in this Agreement for either party to perform any act, except pay monies, neither party shall be liable nor responsible for any delays due to strikes, lockouts, casualties, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental regulation or control or other causes beyond the reasonable control of the parties, and the time period for the performance of such act shall be extended for the amount of time of the delay. This clause shall not result in an extension of the term of this Agreement.</p>

<p>22.11 Timing</p>

<p> Time is of the essence. Except as in Section 22.10, failure to perform any act within the time required or permitted by this Agreement shall be a material breach.</p>

<p>22.12 Withholding Payments</p>

<p> Franchisee shall not, for any reason, withhold payment of any Royalty Fees or other amounts due to Franchisor or to an Affiliate. Franchisee shall not withhold or offset any amounts, damages or other monies allegedly due to Franchisee against any amounts due to Franchisor. No endorsement or statement on any payment for less than the full amount due to Franchisor will be construed as an acknowledgment of payment in full, or an accord and satisfaction, and Franchisor has the right to accept and cash any such payment without prejudice to Franchisor&rsquo;s right to recover the full amount due, or pursue any other remedy provided in this Agreement or by law. Franchisor has the right to apply any payments made by Franchisee against any of Franchisee&rsquo;s past due indebtedness as Franchisor deems appropriate. Franchisor shall set off sums Franchisor owes to Franchisee against any unpaid debts owed by Franchisee to Franchisor.</p>

<p>22.13 Further Assurances</p>

<p> Each party to this Agreement will execute and deliver such further instruments, contracts, forms or other documents, and will perform such further acts, as may be necessary or desirable to perform or complete any term, covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement.</p>

<p>22.14 Third Party Beneficiaries</p>

<p> Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, nothing in this Agreement is intended, nor shall be deemed, to confer upon any person or legal entity other than Franchisor or Franchisee, and their respective successors and assigns as may be contemplated by this Agreement, any rights or remedies under this Agreement.</p>

<p>22.15 Multiple Originals</p>

<p> Both parties will execute multiple copies of this Agreement, and each executed copy will be deemed an original.</p>

<p>23. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</p>

<p>23.1 Choice of Law</p>

<p> Except as to claims governed by federal law, Delaware law governs all claims that in any way relate to or arise out of this Agreement or any of the dealings of the parties (&ldquo;Claims&rdquo;). However, no laws regulating the sale of franchises or governing the relationship between franchisor and franchisee shall apply unless the jurisdictional requirements of such laws are met independently of this paragraph.</p>

<p>23.2 Jurisdiction and Venue</p>

<p> You and we agree that venue and jurisdiction for any Claims, except those required to be submitted to arbitration, shall be proper solely in the state and federal court nearest to our corporate headquarters, presently located in Dover, Delaware. However, if you are an Illinois, Maryland, or Washington State resident or your franchise territory is located in Illinois, Maryland, or Washington State, you agree to bring any Claims, if at all, solely in arbitration before the American Arbitration Association in the city or county where our corporate headquarters are located.</p>

<p>23.3 Jury Waiver</p>

<p> In any trial between any of the parties as to any Claims, you and we agree to waive our rights to a jury trial and instead have such action tried by a judge.</p>

<p>23.4 Class Action Waiver</p>

<p> You agree to bring any Claims, if at all, individually and you shall not join such claim with claims of any other person or entity or bring, join or participate in a class action against us.</p>

<p>23.5 Limitation of Damages</p>

<p> Franchisee and Franchisor each waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any right or claim for any punitive or exemplary damages against the other and agree that if there is a dispute with the other, each will be limited to the recovery of actual damages sustained by it including reasonable accounting and legal fees as provided in Section 22.4. Franchisee waives and disclaims any right to consequential damages in any action or claim against Franchisor concerning this Agreement or any related agreement. In any claim or action brought by Franchisee against Franchisor concerning this Agreement, Franchisee&rsquo;s contract damages shall not exceed and shall be limited to refund of Franchisee&rsquo;s Franchise Fee and Royalty Fees.</p>

<p>23.6 Limitation of Actions  You agree to bring any Claims against us, if at all, within one (1) year of the occurrence of the facts giving rise to such Claims, and that any action not brought within this period shall be barred as a claim, counterclaim, defense, or set-off.</p>

<p>23.7 Prior Notice of Claims</p>

<p> As a condition precedent to commencing an action for a Claim, you must notify us within thirty (30) days after the occurrence of the violation or breach, and failure to timely give such notice shall preclude any claim for damages.</p>

<p>23.8 Internal Dispute Resolution</p>

<p> You must first bring any Claim to our CEO, after providing notice as in Section 23.7 above. You must exhaust this internal dispute resolution procedure before you may bring your Claim before a third party.</p>

<p>23.9 Mediation and Arbitration</p>

<p> Before you may bring any Claim against us, you agree to try for a period of 60 days to mediate such claim before a mutually agreed to mediator in the city or county where our headquarters are located. If we cannot mutually agree on a mediator, you and we agree to use the mediation services of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), and split any AAA and mediator fees equally.</p>

<p> If mediation is unsuccessful and you decide to pursue a legal claim against us, you agree to bring such claim solely in binding arbitration conducted in the city or county where our headquarters is located, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. The proceedings will be held by a single arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding upon the parties. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having personal and subject matter jurisdiction.</p>

<p>23.10 Waiver of Bond</p>

<p>You agree that if we are forced to bring suit to enforce any provision of this Agreement, you agree to waive any requirement that we post bond to obtain a temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunction to enforce these duties.</p>

<p>23.11 Attorney Fees</p>

<p> If we are the substantially prevailing party as to any Claims, you agree to reimburse our costs and attorney fees incurred in pursuing or defending the Claims.</p>

<p>23.12 Third Party Beneficiaries</p>

<p>Our officers, directors, members, shareholders, agents, and employees are express third-party beneficiaries of the terms of the Dispute Resolution provisions contained herein.</p>

<p> Title:   __ SCHEDULE 2 TO THE FRANCHISE AGREEMENT NONDISCLOSURE AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT</p>

<p> This &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo; made as of the  _ day of     _, 20 _, is by and between      , (&ldquo;Franchisee,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us,&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) and        (&ldquo;Individual,&rdquo; &ldquo;you,&rdquo; or &ldquo;your&rdquo;).</p>

<p>W I T N E S S E T H:</p>

<p> WHEREAS, Franchisee is a party to that certain Franchise Agreement dated      , 20__ (&ldquo;Franchise Agreement&rdquo;) by and between Franchisee and the Franchisor, Our Maids Franchise, Inc. (&ldquo;Company&rdquo;); and</p>

<p> WHEREAS, Franchisee desires Individual to have access to and review certain Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information, which are more particularly described below; and</p>

<p> WHEREAS, Franchisee is required by the Franchise Agreement to have Individual execute this Agreement prior to providing Individual access to said Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information; and   WHEREAS, Individual understands the necessity of not disclosing any such information to any other party or using such information to compete against Company, Franchisee or any other franchisee of Company in any business (i) that offers or provides (or grants franchises or licenses to others to operate a business that offers or provides) products and services the same as or similar to those provided by Franchisee or (ii) in which Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information (as defined below) could be used to the disadvantage of Franchisee, or Company, any affiliate of Company or Company&rsquo;s other franchisees (hereinafter, &ldquo;Competitive Business&rdquo;); provided, however, that the term &ldquo;Competitive Business&rdquo; shall not apply to any business operated by Franchisee under a Franchise Agreement with Company.</p>

<p> NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and undertakings stated here, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereby mutually agree as follows:</p>

<p> 1. Trade Secrets and Confidential Information</p>

<p> Individual understands Franchisee possesses and will possess Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information that are important to its business.</p>

<p> a) For the purposes of this Agreement, a &ldquo;Trade Secret&rdquo; is information in any form (including, but not limited to, materials and techniques, technical or non-technical data, formulas, patterns, recipes compilations, programs, devices, methods, techniques, drawings, processes, financial data, financial plans, product plans, passwords, lists of actual or potential customers or suppliers) related to or used in the Our Maids Business that is not commonly known by or available to the public and that information: (i) derives economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (ii) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.</p>

<p> b) For the purposes of this Agreement &ldquo;Confidential Information&rdquo; means technical and non-technical information used in or related to Our Maids that is not commonly known by or available to the public, including, without limitation, Trade Secrets and information contained in the Operations Manual and training guides and materials. In addition, any other information identified as confidential when delivered by Franchisee shall be deemed Confidential Information. Confidential Information shall not include, however, any information that: (i) is now or subsequently becomes generally available to the public through no fault of Individual; (ii) Individual can demonstrate was rightfully in its possession, without obligation of nondisclosure, prior to disclosure according to this Agreement; (iii) is independently developed without the use of any Confidential Information; or (iv) is rightfully obtained from a third party who has the right, without obligation of nondisclosure, to transfer or disclose such information.</p>

<p> c) Any information expressly designated by Company or Franchisee as &ldquo;Trade Secrets&rdquo; or &ldquo;Confidential Information&rdquo; shall be deemed such for all purposes of this Agreement, but the absence of designation shall not relieve Individual of his or her obligations hereunder in respect of information otherwise constituting Trade Secrets or Confidential Information. Individual understands Franchisee&rsquo;s providing of access to the Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information creates a relationship of confidence and trust between Individual and Franchisee with respect to the Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information.</p>

<p> 2. Confidentiality/Non-Disclosure</p>

<p> a) Individual shall not communicate or divulge to (or use for the benefit of) any other person, firm, association, or corporation, with the sole exception of Franchisee, now or at any time in the future, any Trade Secrets or other Confidential Information. At all times from the date of this Agreement, Individual must take all steps reasonably necessary and/or requested by Franchisee to ensure that the Confidential Information and Trade Secrets are kept confidential according to the terms of this Agreement. Individual must comply with all applicable policies, procedures and practices that Franchisee has established and may establish from time to time with regard to the Confidential Information and Trade Secrets.</p>

<p> b) Individual&rsquo;s obligations under paragraph 2(a) of this Agreement shall continue in effect after termination of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee, regardless of the reason or reasons for termination, and whether such termination is voluntary or involuntary, and Franchisee is entitled to communicate Individual&rsquo;s obligations under this Agreement to any future customer or employer to the extent deemed necessary by Franchisee for protection of its rights hereunder and regardless of whether Individual or any of its affiliates or assigns becomes an investor, partner, joint venturer, broker, distributor or the like in an Our Maids Business.</p>

<p> 3. Non-Competition</p>

<p> a) During the term of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee and for a period of two (2) years after the expiration or termination of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee, regardless of the cause of expiration or termination, Individual shall not, directly or indirectly, divert or attempt to divert any business or customer of Franchisee or the Company to any Competitive Business, by direct or indirect inducement or otherwise, or do or perform, directly or indirectly, any other act injurious or prejudicial to the goodwill associated with the Company&rsquo;s service mark &ldquo;Our Maids&rdquo; and such other trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, designs, graphics, logos, emblems, insignia, fascia, slogans, drawings and other commercial symbols as the Company designates to be used in connection with Our Maids or the Company&rsquo;s uniform standards, methods, procedures and specifications for the establishment and operation of an Our Maids business.     b) During the term of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, regardless of the cause of termination, Individual shall not, directly or indirectly, offer Competitive Business services anywhere within a TWENTY FIVE (25) mile radius of any Our Maids location without the express written consent of Franchisee and the Company.</p>

<p> c) During the term of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, regardless of the cause of termination, Individual shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit or otherwise attempt to induce or influence any business associate of Franchisee, Company or any other Our Maids Business to compete against, or terminate or modify his, her or its business relationship with, Franchisee, Company or any other Our Maids Business.</p>

<p> 4. Reasonableness of Restrictions</p>

<p> Individual acknowledges that each of the terms stated here, including the restrictive covenants, is fair and reasonable and is reasonably required for the protection of Franchisee, Company, and Company&rsquo;s Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information, the Company&rsquo;s business system, network of franchises and trade and service marks, and Individual waives any right to challenge these restrictions as being overly broad, unreasonable or otherwise unenforceable. If, however, a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any such restriction is unreasonable or unenforceable, then Individual shall submit to the reduction of any such activity, time period or geographic restriction necessary to enable the court to enforce such restrictions to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. It is the desire and intent of the parties that the provisions of this Agreement shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies applied in any jurisdiction where enforcement is sought.</p>

<p> 5. Relief for Breaches of Confidentiality, Non-Solicitation, and Non-Competition</p>

<p> Individual further acknowledges that an actual or threatened violation of the covenants contained in this Agreement will cause Franchisee and Company immediate and irreparable harm, damage and injury that cannot be fully compensated for by an award of damages or other remedies at law. Accordingly, Franchisee and/or Company shall be entitled, as a matter of right, to an injunction from any court of competent jurisdiction restraining any further violation by Individual of this Agreement without any requirement to show any actual damage or to post any bond or other security. Such right to an injunction shall be cumulative and in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights and remedies that Franchisee and Company may have at law or in equity.</p>

<p> 6. Dispute Resolution</p>

<p> a) Choice of Law. Except as to claims governed by federal law, the local law where the Franchised Business is located governs all claims that in any way relate to or arise out of this Agreement or any of the dealings of the parties (&ldquo;Claims&rdquo;). However, no laws regulating the sale of franchises or governing the relationship between franchisor and franchisee shall apply unless the jurisdictional requirements of such laws are met independently of this paragraph.</p>

<p> b) Jurisdiction and Venue. You and we agree that venue and jurisdiction for any Claims, except those required to be submitted to arbitration, shall be proper solely in the state and federal court nearest to our corporate headquarters.</p>

<p> c) Jury Waiver. In any trial between any of the parties as to any Claims, you and we agree to waive our rights to a jury trial and instead have such action tried by a judge.</p>

<p> d) Class Action Waiver. You agree to bring any Claims, if at all, individually and you shall not join such claim with claims of any other person or entity or bring, join or participate in a class action against us.  e) Punitive Damages Waiver. As to any Claims, you and we agree to waive our rights, if any, to seek or recover punitive damages.</p>

<p> f) Limitation of Actions. You agree to bring any Claims against us, if at all, within one (1) year of the occurrence of the facts giving rise to such Claims, and that any action not brought within this period shall be barred as a claim, counterclaim, defense, or set-off.</p>

<p>g) Prior Notice of Claims. As a condition precedent to commencing an action for a Claim, you must notify us within thirty (30) days after the occurrence of the violation or breach, and failure to timely give such notice shall preclude any claim for damages.</p>

<p>h) Internal Dispute Resolution. You must first bring any Claim to our CEO, after providing notice as in Section 6(g) above. You must exhaust this internal dispute resolution procedure before you may bring your Claim before a third party.</p>

<p> i) Mediation and Arbitration. Before you may bring any Claim against us court, you agree to try for a period of 60 days to mediate such claim before a mutually agreed to mediator in the city or county where our headquarters are located. If we cannot mutually agree on a mediator, you and we agree to use the mediation services of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), and split any AAA and mediator fees equally.</p>

<p> If mediation is unsuccessful and you decide to pursue a legal claim against us, you agree to bring such claim solely in binding arbitration conducted in the city or county of our headquarters in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. The proceedings will be held by a single arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding upon the parties. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having personal and subject matter jurisdiction.</p>

<p>j) Waiver of Bond. You agree that if we are forced to bring suit to enforce any provision of this Agreement, you agree to waive any requirement that we post bond to obtain a temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunction to enforce these duties.</p>

<p>k) Attorney Fees. If we are the substantially prevailing party as to any Claims, you agree to reimburse our costs and attorney fees incurred in pursuing or defending the Claims.</p>

<p> 7. Miscellaneous</p>

<p> a) This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement supersedes any prior agreements, negotiations and discussions between Individual and Franchisee. This Agreement cannot be altered or amended except by an agreement in writing signed by the duly authorized representatives of the parties.</p>

<p> b) This Agreement shall be effective as of the date this Agreement is executed and shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of Individual and shall inure to the benefit of Franchisee, its subsidiaries, successors and assigns. Company is an intended third-party beneficiary of this Agreement with the independent right to enforce the confidentiality and non-competition provisions contained herein.</p>

<p> c) The failure of either party to insist upon performance in any one (1) or more instances upon performance of any terms and conditions of this Agreement shall not be construed a waiver of future performance of any such term, covenant or condition of this Agreement and the obligations of either party with respect thereto shall continue in full force and effect.</p>

<p> d) In the event that any part of this Agreement shall be held to be unenforceable or invalid, the remaining parts hereof shall nevertheless continue to be valid and enforceable as though the invalid portions were not a part hereof.</p>

<p> e) This Agreement may be modified or amended only by a written instrument duly executed by Individual, Franchisee and Company.</p>

<p> f) The existence of any claim or cause of action Individual might have against Franchisee or Company will not constitute a defense to the enforcement by Franchisee or Company of this Agreement.</p>

<p> INDIVIDUAL CERTIFIES THAT HE OR SHE HAS READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY, AND UNDERSTANDS AND ACCEPTS THE OBLIGATIONS THAT IT IMPOSES WITHOUT RESERVATION. NO PROMISES OR REPRESENTATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO SUCH PERSON TO INDUCE THE SIGNING OF THIS AGREEMENT.</p>

<p> THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE COMPANY IS A THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT THE COMPANY SHALL BE ENTITLED TO ENFORCE THIS AGREEMENT WITHOUT THE COOPERATION OF THE FRANCHISEE.

<p>1. Use. Tenant is a franchisee of Franchisor. The Leased Premises shall be used only for the operation of an Our Maids business (or any name authorized by Franchisor).</p>

<p>2. Notice of Default and Opportunity To Cure. Landlord shall provide Franchisor with copies of any written notice of default (&ldquo;Default&rdquo;) given to Tenant under the Lease, and Landlord grants to Franchisor the option (but not the obligation) to cure any Default under the Lease (should Tenant fail to do so) within 10 days after the expiration of the period in which Tenant may cure the Default.</p>

<p>3. Termination of Lease. Landlord shall copy Franchisor on any notice of termination of the Lease. If Landlord terminates the Lease for Tenant&rsquo;s Default, Franchisor shall have the option to enter into a new Lease with Landlord on the same terms and conditions as the terminated Lease, subject to Landlord&rsquo;s approval in its reasonable discretion. To exercise this option, Franchisor must notify Landlord within 10 days after Franchisor receives notice of the termination of the Lease.</p>

<p>4. Termination of Franchise Agreement. If the Franchise Agreement between Franchisor and Tenant is terminated during the term of the Lease, then upon the written request of Franchisor, Landlord and Tenant consent to allow Franchisor to assume any existing term of the Lease (the &ldquo;Assumption&rdquo;), provided that any and all defaults have been cured and all payments due under the Lease are current, and to enter into a written agreement providing for such Assumption. In the event of an Assumption, Landlord will deliver possession of the Leased Premises to Franchisor free and clear of any rights of the Tenant or any third party. Landlord further consents to give Franchisor the right, following the Assumption, to assign its interest in the Lease or to sublet the Leased Premises to another franchisee of Franchisor with reasonable consent from the Landlord.</p>

<p>5. Assignment and Subletting. Notwithstanding any provision of the Lease to the contrary, Tenant shall have the right to assign or sublet the Lease to Franchisor, provided that no such assignment or sublease shall relieve Tenant or any guarantor of liability under the Lease. If Franchisor becomes the lessee of the Leased Premises, then Franchisor shall have the right to assign or sublease its lease to a franchisee of Franchisor&rsquo;s brand, subject to Landlord&rsquo;s approval in its reasonable discretion.</p>

<p>6. Authorization. Tenant authorizes Landlord and Franchisor to communicate directly with each other about Tenant and Tenant&rsquo;s business.</p>

<p> 1. Any claims arising under the Maryland Franchise Registration and Disclosure Law must be brought within 3 years after the grant of the franchise.</p>

<p> 2. A general release required as a condition of renewal, sale, and/or assignment/transfer shall not apply to any liability under the Maryland Franchise Registration and Disclosure Law.</p>

<p>If any of the terms of the Franchise Agreement are inconsistent with the terms below, the terms below control.</p>

<p>Minn. Stat. &sect;80C.21 and Minn. Rule 2860.4400(J) prohibit the franchisor from requiring litigation to be conducted outside Minnesota, requiring waiver of a jury trial, or requiring the franchisee to consent to liquidated damages, termination penalties or judgment notes. In addition, nothing in the Franchise Disclosure Document or agreements can abrogate or reduce (1) any of the franchisee&rsquo;s rights as provided for in Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 80C, or (2) franchisee&rsquo;s rights to any procedure, forum, or remedies provided for by the laws of the jurisdiction.</p>

<p>With respect to franchises governed by Minnesota law, the franchisor will comply with Minn. Stat. Sec. 80C.14 Subds. 3, 4, and 5 which require (except in certain specified cases), that a franchisee be given 90 days&rsquo; notice of termination (with 60 days to cure) and 180 days&rsquo; notice for non-renewal of the franchise agreement and that consent to the transfer of the franchise will not be unreasonably withheld.</p>

<p>Minnesota considers it unfair to not protect the franchisee&rsquo;s right to use the trademarks. Refer to Minnesota Statutes 80C.12, Subd. 1(g).</p>

<p>Minnesota Rules 2860.4400(D) prohibits a franchisor from requiring a franchisee to assent to a general release.</p>

<p>The franchisee cannot consent to the franchisor obtaining injunctive relief. The franchisor may seek injunctive relief. See Minn. Rules 2860.4400J.</p>

<p>Also, a court will determine if a bond is required.</p>

<p>Any Limitations of Claims section must comply with Minnesota Statutes, Section 80C.17, Subd. 5.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON ADDENDUM TO THE FRANCHISE AGREEMENT</p>

<p>If any of the terms of the Franchise Agreement are inconsistent with the terms below, the terms below control.</p>

<p>In the event of a conflict of laws, the provisions of the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, Chapter 19.100 RCW will prevail.</p>

<p>RCW 19.100.180 may supersede the franchise agreement in your relationship with the franchisor including the areas of termination and renewal of your franchise. There may also be court decisions which may supersede the franchise agreement in your relationship with the franchisor including the areas of termination and renewal of your franchise.</p>

<p>In any arbitration or mediation involving a franchise purchased in Washington, the arbitration or mediation site will be either in the state of Washington, or in a place mutually agreed upon at the time of the arbitration or mediation, or as determined by the arbitrator or mediator at the time of arbitration or mediation. In addition, if litigation is not precluded by the franchise agreement, a franchisee may bring an action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with the sale of franchises, or a violation of the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, in Washington.</p>

<p>A release or waiver of rights executed by a franchisee may not include rights under the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act or any rule or order thereunder except when executed pursuant to a negotiated settlement after the agreement is in effect and where the parties are represented by independent counsel. Provisions such as those which unreasonably restrict or limit the statute of limitations period for claims under the Act, or rights or remedies under the Act such as a right to a jury trial, may not be enforceable.</p>

<p>Transfer fees are collectable to the extent that they reflect the franchisor&rsquo;s reasonable estimated or actual costs in effecting a transfer.</p>

<p>Pursuant to RCW 49.62.020, a noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable against an employee, including an employee of a franchisee, unless the employee&rsquo;s earnings from the party seeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed $100,000 per year (an amount that will be adjusted annually for inflation). In addition, a noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable against an independent contractor of a franchisee under RCW 49.62.030 unless the independent contractor&rsquo;s earnings from the party seeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed $250,000 per year (an amount that will be adjusted annually for inflation). As a result, any provisions contained in the franchise agreement or elsewhere that conflict with these limitations are void and unenforceable in Washington.</p>

<p>RCW 49.62.060 prohibits a franchisor from restricting, restraining, or prohibiting a franchisee from (i) soliciting or hiring any employee of a franchisee of the same franchisor or (ii) soliciting or hiring any employee of the franchisor. As a result, any such provisions contained in the franchise agreement or elsewhere are void and unenforceable in Washington.</p>

<p>Section 17.2.2(a) is modified to also provide that the post-term non-compete will only apply to a 25 mile radius of your Franchised Business.</p>

<p>Section 21.3 is modified to also provide that the indemnification does not extend to liabilities resulting from the gross negligence of willful misconduct of any Franchisor indemnitee.</p>

<p> MINNESOTA ADDENDUM TO THE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT</p>

<p>As to franchises governed by the Minnesota franchise laws, if any of the terms of the Disclosure Document are inconsistent with the terms below, the terms below control.</p>

<p>Minn. Stat. &sect;80C.21 and Minn. Rule 2860.4400(J) prohibit the franchisor from requiring litigation to be conducted outside Minnesota, requiring waiver of a jury trial, or requiring the franchisee to consent to liquidated damages, termination penalties or judgment notes. In addition, nothing in the Franchise Disclosure Document or agreements can abrogate or reduce (1) any of the franchisee&rsquo;s rights as provided for in Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 80C, or (2) franchisee&rsquo;s rights to any procedure, forum, or remedies provided for by the laws of the jurisdiction.</p>

<p>With respect to franchises governed by Minnesota law, the franchisor will comply with Minn. Stat. Sec. 80C.14 Subds. 3, 4, and 5 which require (except in certain specified cases), that a franchisee be given 90 days&rsquo; notice of termination (with 60 days to cure) and 180 days&rsquo; notice for non-renewal of the franchise agreement and that consent to the transfer of the franchise will not be unreasonably withheld.</p>

<p>Minnesota considers it unfair to not protect the franchisee&rsquo;s right to use the trademarks. Refer to Minnesota Statutes 80C.12, Subd. 1(g).</p>

<p>Minnesota Rules 2860.4400(D) prohibits a franchisor from requiring a franchisee to assent to a general release.</p>

<p>The franchisee cannot consent to the franchisor obtaining injunctive relief. The franchisor may seek injunctive relief. See Minn. Rules 2860.4400J.</p>

<p>2. The following is added at the end of Item 3:</p>

<p> D. No such party is subject to a currently effective injunctive or restrictive order or decree relating to the franchise, or under a Federal, State or Canadian franchise, securities, antitrust, trade regulation or trade practice law, resulting from a concluded or pending action or proceeding brought by a public agency, or is subject to any currently effective order of any national securities association or national securities exchange, as defined in the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, suspending or expelling such person from membership in such association or exchange; or is subject to a currently effective injunctive or restrictive order relating to any other business activity as a result of an action brought by a public agency or department, including, without limitation, actions affecting a license as a real estate broker or sales agent.</p>

<p> 3. The following is added to the end of the &ldquo;Summary&rdquo; sections of Item 17(c), titled &ldquo;Requirements for franchisee to renew or extend,&rdquo; and Item 17(m), entitled &ldquo;Conditions for franchisor approval of transfer&rdquo;:</p>

<p>However, to the extent required by applicable law, all rights you enjoy and any causes of action arising in your favor from the provisions of Article 33 of the General Business Law of the State of New York and the regulations issued thereunder shall remain in force; it being the intent of this proviso that the non-waiver provisions of General Business Law Sections 687.4 and 687.5 be satisfied.</p>

<p>4. The following language replaces the &ldquo;Summary&rdquo; section of Item 17(d), titled &ldquo;Termination by franchisee&rdquo;:</p>

Instead, the prevailing party in any enforcement action is entitled to recover all costs and expenses including attorney's fees. RHODE ISLAND ADDENDUM TO THE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT</p>

<p>Section 19-28.1-14 of the Rhode Island Franchise Investment Act prohibits a franchisee to be restricted in choice of jurisdiction or venue. To the extent any such restriction is purported to be required by us, it is void with respect to all franchisees governed under the laws of Rhode Island.</p>

<p>Item 17.w. of the Disclosure Document is revised to provide:</p>

<p>Rhode Island law applies.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON ADDENDUM TO THE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT</p>

<p>As to franchises governed by the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, if any of the terms of the Disclosure Document are inconsistent with the terms below, the terms below control.</p>

<p>In the event of a conflict of laws, the provisions of the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, Chapter 19.100 RCW will prevail.</p>

<p>RCW 19.100.180 may supersede the franchise agreement in your relationship with the franchisor including the areas of termination and renewal of your franchise. There may also be court decisions which may supersede the franchise agreement in your relationship with the franchisor including the areas of termination and renewal of your franchise.</p>

<p>In any arbitration or mediation involving a franchise purchased in Washington, the arbitration or mediation site will be either in the state of Washington, or in a place mutually agreed upon at the time of the arbitration or mediation, or as determined by the arbitrator or mediator at the time of arbitration or mediation. In addition, if litigation is not precluded by the franchise agreement, a franchisee may bring an action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with the sale of franchises, or a violation of the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, in Washington.</p>

<p>A release or waiver of rights executed by a franchisee may not include rights under the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act or any rule or order thereunder except when executed pursuant to a negotiated settlement after the agreement is in effect and where the parties are represented by independent counsel. Provisions such as those which unreasonably restrict or limit the statute of limitations period for claims under the Act, or rights or remedies under the Act such as a right to a jury trial, may not be enforceable.</p>

<p>Transfer fees are collectable to the extent that they reflect the franchisor&rsquo;s reasonable estimated or actual costs in effecting a transfer.</p>

<p>Pursuant to RCW 49.62.020, a noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable against an employee, including an employee of a franchisee, unless the employee&rsquo;s earnings from the party seeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed $100,000 per year (an amount that will be adjusted annually for inflation). In addition, a noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable against an independent contractor of a franchisee under RCW 49.62.030 unless the independent contractor&rsquo;s earnings from the party seeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed $250,000 per year (an amount that will be adjusted annually for inflation). As a result, any provisions contained in the franchise agreement or elsewhere that conflict with these limitations are void and unenforceable in Washington.</p>

<p>RCW 49.62.060 prohibits a franchisor from restricting, restraining, or prohibiting a franchisee from (i) soliciting or hiring any employee of a franchisee of the same franchisor or (ii) soliciting or hiring any employee of the franchisor. As a result, any such provisions contained in the franchise agreement or elsewhere are void and unenforceable in Washington.</p>

<p>A release or waiver of rights signed by the franchisee shall not include rights under the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act except when executed according to a negotiated settlement after the agreement is in effect and where the parties are represented by independent counsel. Provisions such as those that unreasonably restrict or limit the statute of limitations period for claims under the Act, rights or remedies under the Act such as a right to a jury trial may not be enforceable.</p>

<p>Item 17.r. is modified to also provide that the post-term non-compete will only apply to a 25 mile radius of your Franchised Business.</p>

<p></p>

<p> WISCONSIN ADDENDUM TO THE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT</p>

<p>As to franchises governed by the Wisconsin Fair Dealership Law, if any of the terms of the Disclosure Document are inconsistent with the terms below, the terms below control.</p>

<p>Item 17 is modified to also provide:</p>

<p>If the franchise agreement contains any provisions that conflict with the Wisconsin Fair Dealership Law, the provisions of this Addendum shall prevail to the extent of such conflict.</p>

<p>With respect to franchises governed by Wisconsin law, the Wisconsin Fair Dealership Law applies to most, if not all, franchise agreements and prohibits the termination, cancellation, non-renewal or the substantial change of the competitive circumstances of a dealership agreement without good cause. That Law further provides that 90 days&rsquo; prior written notice of a proposed termination, etc. must be given to the dealer. The dealer has 60 days to cure the deficiency and if the deficiency is cured, the notice is void.</p>

<p>How to Use This Franchise Disclosure Document</p>

<p>Here are some questions you may be asking about buying a franchise and tips on how to find more information:</p>

<p>What You Need To Know About Franchising Generally</p>

<p>Continuing responsibility to pay fees. You may have to pay royalties and other fees even if you are losing money.    Business model can change. The franchise agreement may allow the franchisor to change its manuals and business model without your consent. These changes may require you to make additional investments in your franchise business or may harm your franchise business.    Supplier restrictions. You may have to buy or lease items from the franchisor or a limited group of suppliers the franchisor designates. These items may be more expensive than similar items you could buy on your own.    Operating restrictions. The franchise agreement may prohibit you from operating a similar business during the term of the franchise. There are usually other restrictions. Some examples may include controlling your location, your access to customers, what you sell, how you market, and your hours of operation.    Competition from franchisor. Even if the franchise agreement grants you a territory, the franchisor may have the right to compete with you in your territory.    Renewal. Your franchise agreement may not permit you to renew. Even if it does, you may have to sign a new agreement with different terms and conditions in order to continue to operate your franchise business.    When your franchise ends. The franchise agreement may prohibit you from operating a similar business after your franchise ends even if you still have obligations to your landlord or other creditors.    Some States Require Registration   Your state may have a franchise law, or other law, that requires franchisors to register before offering or selling franchises in the state. Registration does not mean that the state recommends the franchise or has verified the information in this document. To find out if your state has a registration requirement, or to contact your state, use the agency information in Exhibit A.    Your state also may have laws that require special disclosures or amendments be made to your franchise agreement. If so, you should check the State Specific Addenda. See the Table of Contents for the location of the State Specific Addenda.  </p>

<p>Special Risks to Consider About This Franchise   Certain states require that the following risk(s) be highlighted:     1. Out-of-State Dispute Resolution. The franchise agreement requires you to resolve disputes with the franchisor by mediation, arbitration and/or litigation only in Delaware. Out-of-state mediation, arbitration, or litigation may force you to accept a less favorable settlement for disputes. It may also cost more to mediate, arbitrate, or litigate with the franchisor in Delaware than in your own state.</p>

<p> 2. Short Operating History. The franchisor is at an early stage of development and has a limited operating history. This franchise is likely to be a riskier investment than a franchise in a system with a longer operating history.</p>

<p> 3. Financial Condition. The Franchisor&rsquo;s financial condition as reflected in its financial statements (see Item 21) calls into question the Franchisor&rsquo;s financial ability to provide services and support to you.</p>

<p>Certain states may require other risks to be highlighted. Check the &ldquo;State Specific Addenda&rdquo; (if any) to see whether your state requires other risks to be highlighted.</p>

<p>MICHIGAN ADDENDUM TO THE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT</p>

<p>THE STATE OF MICHIGAN PROHIBITS CERTAIN UNFAIR PROVISIONS THAT ARE SOMETIMES IN FRANCHISE DOCUMENTS. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS ARE IN THESE FRANCHISE DOCUMENTS, THE PROVISIONS ARE VOID AND CANNOT BE ENFORCED AGAINST YOU:</p>

<p>(a) A prohibition on the right of a franchisee to join an association of franchisees.</p>

<p>(b) A requirement that a franchisee assent to a release, assignment, novation, waiver, or estoppel which deprives a franchisee of rights and protections provided in this act. This shall not preclude a franchisee, after entering into a franchise agreement, from settling any and all claims.</p>

<p>(c) A provision that permits a franchisor to terminate a franchise prior to the expiration of its term except for good cause. Good cause shall include the failure of the franchisee to comply with any lawful provision of the franchise agreement and to cure such failure after being given written notice thereof and a reasonable opportunity, which in no event need be more than 30 days, to cure such failure.</p>

<p>(d) A provision that permits a franchisor to refuse to renew a franchise without fairly compensating the franchisee by repurchase or other means for the fair market value at the time of expiration of the franchisee&rsquo;s inventory, supplies, equipment, fixtures, and furnishings. Personalized materials which have no value to the franchisor and inventory, supplies, equipment, fixtures, and furnishings not reasonably required in the conduct of the franchise business are not subject to compensation. This subsection applies only if: (i) The term of the franchise is less than 5 years and (ii) the franchisee is prohibited by the franchise or other agreement from continuing to conduct substantially the same business under another trademark, service mark, trade name, logo type, advertising, or other commercial symbol in the same area subsequent to the expiration of the franchise or the franchisee does not receive at least 6 months advance notice of franchisor&rsquo;s intent not to renew the franchise.</p>

<p>(e) A provision that permits the franchisor to refuse to renew a franchise on terms generally available to other franchisees of the same class or type under similar circumstances. This section does not require a renewal provision.</p>

<p>(f) A provision requiring that arbitration or litigation be conducted outside this state. This shall not preclude the franchisee from entering into an agreement, at the time of arbitration, to conduct arbitration at a location outside this state.</p>

<p>(g) A provision which permits a franchisor to refuse to permit a transfer of ownership of a franchise, except for good cause. This subdivision does not prevent a franchisor from exercising a right of first refusal to purchase the franchise. Good cause shall include, but is not limited to: (i) The failure of the proposed transferee to meet the franchisor&rsquo;s then current reasonable qualifications or standards; (ii) The fact that the proposed transferee is a competitor of the franchisor or subfranchisor; (iii) The unwillingness of the proposed transferee to agree in writing to comply with all lawful obligations; (iv) The failure of the franchisee or proposed transferee to pay any sums owing to the franchisor or to cure any default in the franchise agreement existing at the time of the proposed transfer.</p>

<p>(h) A provision that requires the franchisee to resell to the franchisor items that are not uniquely identified with the franchisor. This subdivision does not prohibit a provision that grants to a franchisor a right of first refusal to purchase the assets of a franchise on the same terms and conditions as a bona fide third party willing and able to purchase those assets, nor does this subdivision prohibit a provision that grants the franchisor the right to acquire the assets of a franchise for the market or appraised value of such assets if the franchisee has breached the lawful provisions of the franchise agreement and has failed to cure the breach in the manner provided in subdivision (c).</p>

<p>(i) A provision which permits the franchisor to directly or indirectly convey, assign, or otherwise transfer its obligation to fulfill contractual obligations to the franchisee unless provision has been made for providing the required contractual services.</p>

<p>THE FACT THAT THERE IS A NOTICE OF THIS OFFERING ON FILE WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOES NOT CONSTITUTE APPROVAL, RECOMMENDATION, OR ENDORSEMENT BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.</p>

<p>11Total- We do not offer financing directly or indirectly for any part of the initial investment.</p>

<p>B. AREA DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT</p>

<p></p>

<p>Note 1- The low-end comprises of the initial franchise fee of $20,000 plus the $20,000 for the additional two outlets ($10,000 x 2). The high-end comprises of the initial franchise fee of $20,000 plus the $50,000 for the additional four outlets ($10,000 x 4).</p>

<p>Note 2-The low-end comprises of the low-end estimate from the Item 7.A table, less the $20,000 initial franchise fee, as it is included in the Area Development Fee ($42,500 - $20,000 = $22,500). The high-end comprises of the high-end estimate from the Item 7.A table, less the $20,000 initial franchise fee, as it is included in the Area Development Fee ($55,250 - $20,000 = $35,250).</p>

<p>The estimates in this Chart 7(B) assume that you will be entering into an Area Development Agreement for the right to open and operate three to five Franchised Businesses within a Development Area and the cost of opening the first Franchised Business.</p>

<p>The Area Development Fee ranges from $40,000 to $60,000 for three to five territories, as explained in Item 5 above. The Area Development Fee includes the Initial Franchise Fee on the first territory purchased under the Development Agreement and one-half the Initial Franchise Fee on additional territories. You pay the remaining one-half of the Initial Franchise Fee on additional territories at the time you enter into Franchise Agreements for such territories.</p>

You will be responsible for all travel costs, room and board and employees&rsquo; salaries incurred in connection with its attendance at such training. (Section 8.4 of the Franchise Agreement).</p>

<p>ITEM 12. TERRITORY</p>

<p>The territory will be for a specific geographic region that we define and approve by radius, zip codes, natural, or political boundaries as set forth in the Franchise Agreement.</p>

<p>A territory will normally include an area of 200,000 households.</p>

<p>We would not normally have occasion to approve relocation of the franchised business because you will work from your home and a vehicle.</p>

<p>We would not normally grant to you approval to open an additional outlet within your territory, but may grant you additional franchise territories if we feel you have the time, energy, capital, and management structure to be able to successfully open and operate another territory.</p>

<p>We do not grant you options, rights of first refusal, or similar rights to acquire additional franchises.</p>

<p>You will receive an exclusive territory, meaning a geographic area within which we promise not to establish either a company-owned or franchised outlet selling the same or similar goods or services under the same or similar trademarks or service marks.</p>

<p>Continuation of your territorial rights does not depend on achieving a certain sales volume, market penetration, or other contingency, and we may not alter your franchise territory, even if there is a population increase in your territory.</p>

<p>We or an affiliate reserves the right to use other channels of distribution, such as the Internet, catalog sales, telemarketing, or other direct marketing sales, to solicit or accept orders within your territory using our principal trademarks, however, we would normally direct inquiries for services from within your territory to your outlet.</p>

<p>We or an affiliate also reserves the right to use other channels of distribution, such as the Internet, catalog sales, telemarketing, or other direct marketing sales, to make sales within your territory of products or services under trademarks different from the ones that you will use under the franchise agreement.</p>

<p>We are not obligated to pay compensation to you for soliciting or accepting orders from inside your territory.</p>

<p>You and other franchisees may not solicit (but may accept) orders from consumers outside of your territory, including through the use of other channels of distribution, such as the Internet, catalog sales, telemarketing, or other direct marketing, but you may engage in internet and social media marketing pursuant to our guidelines which such marketing may extend outside your territory. We also reserve the right to implement cross-territorial protocols and other guidelines applicable to such situations as group advertising buys by multiple franchisees which may extend into multiple territories, solicitation of orders of individuals who may reside in one territory, yet work in another, and other cross-territorial situations. You agree to abide by any such cross-territorial protocols.</p>

<p>Neither we nor an affiliate operates, franchises, or has plans to operate or franchise a business under a different trademark which such business sells or will sell goods or services similar to those you will offer, but we reserve the right to do so.</p>

<p>Area Developers:</p>

<p> Under the Area Development Agreement (the &ldquo;ADA&rdquo;), you will develop, open and operate multiple outlets within a defined Development Area (the &ldquo;Development Area&rdquo;). We determine the Development Area using the same criteria that we use in deciding the Territory for a Business.</p>

<p>ITEM 13. TRADEMARKS</p>

<p>The franchise agreement licenses to you the right to use the following principal trademarks (&ldquo;Marks&rdquo;) registered or applied for with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (&ldquo;USPTO&rdquo;):</p>

<p></p>

<p> We do not have a federal registration for our principal trademark. SERIAL/ REGISTRATION NO. 7036264: PRINCIPAL REGISTER: REGISTRATION DATE, APRIL 25, 2023.</p>

<p>There are no currently effective agreements that significantly limit our rights to use or license the use of our trademarks listed in this section.</p>

<p>There are no currently effective determinations of the USPTO, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, or any state trademark administrator or any court; or any pending infringement, opposition, or cancellation proceeding in which we unsuccessfully sought to prevent registration of a trademark in order to protect a trademark licensed by the franchisor. There is no pending material federal or state court litigation regarding our use or ownership rights in a trademark.</p>

<p>We know of no infringing or prior superior uses that could materially affect the use of the Marks.</p>

<p>You do not receive any rights to the Marks other than the right to use them in the operation of your Franchised Business. You must follow our rules when you use the Marks. You must use the Marks as the sole trade identification of the franchised business. You cannot use any Mark or portion of any Mark as part of any business entity name. You may not use any Mark in connection with the sale of any unauthorized services or products, or in any other manner that we do not authorize in writing. You must obtain a fictitious or assumed name registration if required by your state or local law. Any unauthorized use of the Marks by you is a breach of the Franchise Agreement and an infringement of our rights in the Marks. You must not contest the validity or ownership of the Marks, including any Marks that we license to you after you sign the Franchise Agreement. You must not assist any other person in contesting the validity or ownership of the Marks.</p>

<p>You must immediately notify us in writing when you learn about any claim of infringement, unfair competition, or similar claims about the Marks. You must not communicate with any person other than us and our counsel regarding any infringements, challenges or claims unless you are legally required to do so. However, you may communicate with your own counsel at your own expense. We are not required to take affirmative action when notified of these uses or claims. We have the sole right to control any administrative or judicial proceeding involving a trademark licensed by us. The Franchise Agreement does not require us to participate in your defense or indemnify you for expenses or damages if you are a party to an administrative or judicial proceeding involving a trademark licensed by us to you or if the proceeding is resolved unfavorable to you. You must take any actions that, in the opinion of our counsel, may be advisable to protect and maintain our interests in any proceeding or to otherwise protect and maintain our interests in the Marks.</p>

<p>If we require, you must modify or discontinue the use of any Mark and use other trademarks or service marks we designate. We do not have to reimburse you for modifying or discontinuing the use of a Mark or for substituting another trademark or service mark for a discontinued Mark. If we adopt and use new or modified Marks, you must add or replace equipment, supplies and fixtures, and you must make other modifications we designate as necessary to adapt your franchised business for the new or modified Marks. We do not reimburse you for any loss of goodwill associated with a modified or discontinued Mark.</p>

<p>You must notify us if you apply for your own trademark or service mark registrations. You must not register or seek to register as a trademark or service mark, either with the USPTO or any state or foreign country, any of the Marks or a trademark or service mark that is confusingly similar to any of our Marks.</p>

<p>ITEM 14. PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION</p>

<p>No patents or pending patent applications are material to the franchise. We own copyrights in the Operations Manual, our website, our marketing materials, training manuals or videos, and other copyrightable items that are part of the System. While we claim copyrights in these and similar items, we have not registered these copyrights with the United States Register of Copyrights. You may use these items only as we specify while operating the Franchised Business and you must stop using them if we direct you to do so.</p>

<p>We do not have an obligation to protect the copyrights or to defend you against claims arising from your use of the copyrighted items. You must notify us if any claim for copyright infringement is brought against you over materials in which we claim a copyright. We have the right to control litigation over our copyrights. We are not required to participate in your defense or indemnify you for expenses and damages in a proceeding involving a copyright licensed to you. Your rights in the franchise agreement would continue if we require you to modify or discontinue using the subject matter covered by the copyright.</p>

<p>We know of no effective determinations of the U.S. Copyright Office or any court regarding any of our copyrighted materials. Our right to use or license copyrighted items is not materially limited by any agreement or known infringing use.</p>

<p>We have developed certain trade secrets and other confidential information, including methods of business management, sales and promotion techniques, and know-how, knowledge of, and experience in, operating an Our Maids Business. We will provide our trade secrets and other confidential information to you during training, in the Operations Manual and as a result of the assistance we furnish you during the term of the franchise. You may only use the trade secrets and other confidential information for the purpose of operating your Franchised Business. You may only divulge trade secrets and/or other confidential information to employees who must have access to it to operate the Franchised Business. You are responsible for enforcing the confidentiality provisions as to your employees.</p>

<p>Certain individuals with access to trade secrets or other confidential information, including your shareholders, officers, directors, partners, members, if you are a corporation, limited liability company or other business entity, and your managers, executives, employees and staff may be required to sign nondisclosure and non-competition agreements in a form the same as or similar to the Nondisclosure and Non-Competition Agreement attached to the Franchise Agreement. We will be a third-party beneficiary with the right to enforce those agreements.</p>

<p>All ideas, concepts, techniques or materials concerning the franchised business and/or the System, whether or not protectable intellectual property and whether created by or for you or your owners or employees, must be promptly disclosed to us and will be deemed our sole and exclusive property and a part of the System that we may choose to adopt and/or disclose to other franchisees, and you agree to assign to us all right, title and interest in any intellectual property so developed without additional compensation to you. Likewise, we will disclose to you concepts and developments of other franchisees that we make part of the System. You must also assist us in obtaining intellectual property rights in any concept or development if requested.</p>

<p>Your use of the Operations Manual, trade secrets or other confidential information in an unauthorized manner is a default of the Franchise Agreement that may result in automatic termination of the Franchise Agreement. Further information about termination of the Franchise Agreement following a default is included in Item 17.</p>

<p>ITEM 15. OBLIGATION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ACTUAL OPERATION OF THE FRANCHISE BUSINESS</p>

<p>Either the Franchisee or its on-site Designated Manager must devote sufficient efforts to the management of the day-to-day operations of the Franchised Business, but not less than forty (40) hours per week. While you have the right to select any Designated Manager, we retain the right to accept or reject any proposed individual or entity as the Designated Manager. You will be responsible for the compensation to any individual or entity you contract to act as the Designated Manager of the Business. You have the sole legal responsibility for any dispute relating to such individual or entity. We maintain the right to require any approved Designated Manager to attend and satisfactorily complete our initial training program before opening the Business. You must keep us informed at all times of the identity of your Designated Manager. If you must replace the Designated Manager, your replacement Manager must be approved by us within 60 days, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld &ndash; we may additionally require such replacement Designated Manager to attend and complete our training program at your expense. If the Franchisee is an entity, its Designated Manager is not required to own an equity interest in the Franchisee.</p>

<p>As described in ITEM 14, certain individuals associated with your Franchised Business, including your owners, officers, directors, partners, and your managers, executives, employees, and staff may be required to sign nondisclosure and non-competition agreements the same as or similar to the Nondisclosure and Non-Competition Agreement attached to the Franchise Agreement. We will be a third-party beneficiary with the independent right to enforce the agreements.</p>

<p>If you are a corporation or other business entity, anyone who owns a 5% or greater interest in the entity must personally guarantee the performance of all of your obligations under the Franchise Agreement and agree to be personally liable for your breach of the Franchise Agreement by signing the Unlimited Guaranty and Assumption of Obligations attached to the Franchise Agreement.</p>

<p>ITEM 16. RESTRICTIONS ON WHAT THE FRANCHISEE MAY SELL</p>

<p>You must offer and sell all the services and products we specify. You may not sell any services or products that we have not authorized and you must discontinue offering any services or products that we may disapprove of. We may take action, including terminating your franchise if you purchase or sell unapproved products or make purchases from unapproved suppliers. We may periodically change required or authorized services or products. There are no limits on our right to do so, except that your investment required to change required or authorized products or services will not be unreasonably disproportionate to your initial investment.</p>

<p>Periodically, we may allow certain services or products that are not otherwise authorized for general use as a part of the System to be offered locally or regionally based on factors, including test marketing, your qualifications, and regional or local differences.</p>

<p> We do not place restrictions on you with respect to who may be a customer of your Franchised Business.</p>

Accordingly, Franchisee shall provide or offer for sale or use at the Franchised Business only those services, with the greatest diligence and care by Franchisee, that Franchisor approves (and which are not thereafter disapproved) and that comply with Franchisor&rsquo;s specifications and quality standards. If required by Franchisor, any such items or services shall be purchased only from Franchisor.

If Franchisor or an Affiliate is an Approved Supplier, Franchisee shall execute a standard form purchase or supply agreement for the items to be supplied by Franchisor or its Affiliate. If Franchisee desires to utilize any products, services or new technology that Franchisor has not approved (for products and services that require supplier approval), Franchisee shall first send Franchisor sufficient information, specifications and samples for Franchisor to determine whether the service or product complies with its standards and specifications or whether the supplier meets its Approved Supplier criteria.

Franchisor will decide within a reasonable time (usually thirty [30] days) after receiving the required information whether Franchisee may purchase or lease such items or services or from such supplier. Approval of a supplier may be conditioned on the supplier&rsquo;s ability to provide sufficient quantity of product; quality of products or services at competitive prices; production and delivery capability; and dependability and general reputation.

This Section is not intended as an approval of Franchisee&rsquo;s right to operate other businesses and in no way is it intended to contradict Sections 17, 17.1 or 17.2. Franchisee shall make such modifications or alterations to the Franchised Business (including changing telephone and facsimile numbers) immediately upon termination or expiration of this Agreement as may be necessary to prevent any association between Franchisor or the System and any business subsequently operated by Franchisee or others at the Franchised Business. Franchisee shall make such specific additional changes to the Franchised Business as Franchisor may reasonably request for that purpose including, without limitation, removal of all physical and structural features identifying or distinctive to the System. If Franchisee fails or refuses to comply with the requirements of this Section, Franchisor has the right to enter upon the Franchised Business for the purpose of making or causing to be made such changes as may be required, at the expense of Franchisee, which expense Franchisee shall pay upon demand.</p>

<p>17.4 Franchisor&rsquo;s Option to Purchase Certain Business Assets</p>

<p> Franchisor has the right (but not the obligation), for a period of thirty (30) days after termination or expiration of this Agreement, to purchase any or all assets of the Franchised Business including improvements, vehicles, service tools and equipment, supplies and other inventory or equipment. The purchase price shall be equal to the assets&rsquo; book value. If Franchisor elects to exercise this option to purchase, it has the right to set off all amounts due from Franchisee under this Agreement, if any, against the purchase price.</p>

<p>17.5 Survival of Certain Provisions</p>

<p> All obligations of Franchisor and Franchisee, which expressly or by their nature survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement, shall continue in full force and effect subsequent to and notwithstanding their expiration or termination and until satisfied or by their nature expire.</p>

<p>18. TRANSFERABILITY OF INTEREST</p>

<p>18.1 Transfer by Franchisor</p>

<p> This Agreement and all rights and duties hereunder are fully transferable in whole or in part by Franchisor and such rights will inure to the benefit of any person or entity to whom transferred; provided, however, that with respect to any assignment resulting in the subsequent performance by the assignee of the functions of Franchisor, the assignee shall assume the obligations of Franchisor hereunder and Franchisor shall thereafter have no liability for the performance of any obligations contained in this Agreement.</p>

<p>18.2 Transfer by Franchisee to a Third Party</p>

<p> The rights and duties of Franchisee as in this Agreement, and the Franchise herein granted, are personal to Franchisee (or its owners), and Franchisor has entered into this Agreement in reliance upon Franchisee&rsquo;s personal or collective skill and financial ability. Accordingly, neither Franchisee nor any holder of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisee may sell, assign, convey, give away, pledge, mortgage, sublicense or otherwise transfer, whether by operation of law or otherwise, any interest in this Agreement, the Franchise granted hereby, the assets of the Franchised Business or any part or all of the ownership interest in Franchisee without the prior written approval of Franchisor. Any purported transfer without such approval shall be null and void and shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement. If Franchisee is in compliance with this Agreement, Franchisor&rsquo;s consent to such transfer shall be conditioned upon the satisfaction of the following requirements:</p>

<p>Franchisee has complied with the requirements in Section 19;</p>

<p>all obligations owed to Franchisor, and all other outstanding obligations relating to the Franchised Business, are fully paid and satisfied;</p>

<p>Franchisee (and any transferring owners, if Franchisee is a business entity) has executed a general release, in a form the same as or similar to the General Release attached as Schedule 1, of any and all claims against Franchisor, including its officers, directors, shareholders, managers, members, partners, owners, employees and agents (in their corporate and individual capacities), including, without limitation, claims arising under federal, state or local laws, rules or ordinances, and any other matters incident to the termination of this Agreement or to the transfer of Franchisee&rsquo;s interest herein or to the transfer of Franchisee&rsquo;s ownership of all or any part of the Franchise; provided, however, that if a general release is prohibited, Franchisee shall give the maximum release allowed by law;</p>

<p>the prospective transferee has satisfied Franchisor that it meets Franchisor&rsquo;s management, business and financial standards, and otherwise possesses the character and capabilities, including business reputation and credit rating, as Franchisor may require to demonstrate ability to conduct the Franchised Business;</p>

<p>the transferee and, if Franchisor requires, all persons owning any interest in the transferee, have executed the then-current franchise agreement for new franchisees, which may be substantially different from this Agreement, including different Royalty Fee and other material provisions, and the franchise agreement then executed shall be for the term specified in such agreement;</p>

<p>the transferee has executed a general release, in a form the same as or similar to the General Release attached as Schedule 1, of any and all claims against Franchisor and its officers, directors, shareholders, managers, members, partners, owners, employees and agents (in their corporate and individual capacities), with respect to any representations regarding the Franchise or the business conducted pursuant thereto or any other matter that may have been made to the transferee by Franchisee;</p>

<p>Franchisee has provided Franchisor with a complete copy of all contracts and agreements and related documentation between Franchisee and the prospective transferee relating to the intended sale or transfer of the Franchise;</p>

<p>Franchisee, or the transferee, has paid to Franchisor, before the transaction is completed, a transfer fee in the amount of 25% of the then current initial franchise fee;</p>

<p>the transferee, or all holders of a legal or beneficial interest in the transferee, has agreed to be personally bound jointly and severally by all provisions of this Agreement for the remainder of its term by executing a personal guaranty in such form as prepared by Franchisor;</p>

<p>the transferee has obtained all necessary consents and approvals by third parties and all applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules, ordinances, and requirements applicable to the transfer have been complied with or satisfied;</p>

<p>Franchisee has, and if Franchisee is an entity, all of the holders of a legal and beneficial interest in Franchisee have executed and delivered to Franchisor a nondisclosure and non-competition agreement in a form satisfactory to Franchisor and in substance the same as the nondisclosure and non-competition covenants contained in Sections 7 and 17; and</p>

<p>the transferee agrees that it shall complete, to Franchisor&rsquo;s satisfaction, a training program in substance similar to the initial training described in Section 8.1 prior to assuming the management of the day-to-day operation of the Franchised Business.</p>

<p>18.3 Transfer to a Controlled Entity</p>

<p> 18.3.1 If Franchisee wishes to transfer this Agreement or any interest herein to a corporation, limited liability company or other legal entity which shall be entirely owned by Franchisee (&ldquo;Controlled Entity&rdquo;), which Controlled Entity is being formed for the financial planning, tax or other convenience of Franchisee, Franchisor&rsquo;s consent to such transfer shall be conditioned upon the satisfaction of the following requirements:</p>

<p>the Controlled Entity is newly organized and its charter or articles of formation provides that its activities are confined exclusively to the operation of the Franchised Business;</p>

<p>Franchisee or all holders of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisee own all of the equity and voting power of the outstanding stock or other capital interest in the Controlled Entity;</p>

<p>all obligations of Franchisee to Franchisor or any Affiliate are fully paid and satisfied; provided, however, that neither Franchisee nor the Controlled Entity shall be required to pay a transfer fee as required according to Section 18.2(h);</p>

<p>the Controlled Entity has entered into a written agreement with Franchisor expressly assuming the obligations of this Agreement and all other agreements relating to the operation of the Franchised Business. If the consent of any other party to any such other agreement is required, Franchisee has obtained such written consent and provided the same to Franchisor prior to consent by Franchisor;</p>

<p>all holders of a legal or beneficial interest in the Controlled Entity have entered into an agreement with Franchisor jointly and severally guaranteeing the full payment of the Controlled Entity&rsquo;s obligations to Franchisor and the performance by the Controlled Entity of all the obligations of this Agreement;</p>

<p>each stock certificate or other ownership interest certificate of the Controlled Entity has conspicuously endorsed upon the face thereof a statement in a form satisfactory to Franchisor that it is held subject to, and that further assignment or transfer thereof is subject to, all restrictions imposed upon transfers and assignments by this Agreement; and</p>

<p>copies of the Controlled Entity&rsquo;s articles of incorporation or organization, bylaws, operating agreement, federal tax identification number, and other governing regulations or documents, including resolutions of the board of directors authorizing entry into this Agreement, have been promptly furnished to Franchisor. Any amendment to any such documents shall also be furnished to Franchisor immediately upon adoption.</p>

<p> 18.3.2 The term of the transferred franchise shall be the unexpired term of this Agreement, including all renewal rights, subject to any and all conditions applicable to such renewal rights.</p>

<p> 18.3.3 Franchisor&rsquo;s consent to a transfer of any interest in this Agreement, or of any ownership interest in the Franchised Business, shall not constitute a waiver of any claims Franchisor may have against the transferor or the transferee, nor shall it be deemed a waiver of Franchisor&rsquo;s right to demand compliance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>

<p>18.4 Franchisor&rsquo;s Disclosure to Transferee</p>

<p> Franchisor has the right, without liability of any kind or nature whatsoever to Franchisee, to make available for inspection by any intended transferee of Franchisee all or any part of Franchisor&rsquo;s records relating to this Agreement, the Franchised Business or to the history of the relationship of the parties hereto. Franchisee hereby specifically consents to such disclosure by Franchisor and shall release and hold Franchisor harmless from and against any claim, loss or injury resulting from an inspection of Franchisor&rsquo;s records relating to the Franchised Business by an intended transferee identified by Franchisee.</p>

<p>18.5 For-Sale Advertising</p>

<p> Franchisee shall NOT, without prior written consent of Franchisor, place in, on or upon the area of the Franchised Business, or in any communication media, any form of advertising relating to the sale of the Franchised Business or the rights granted hereunder.</p>

<p>18.6 Transfer by Death or Incapacity</p>

<p> Upon the death or Incapacity of Franchisee (if Franchisee is an individual) or any holder of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisee (if Franchisee is a business entity), the appropriate representative of such person (whether administrator, personal representative or trustee) shall, within a reasonable time not exceeding one hundred eighty (180) days following such event, transfer such individual&rsquo;s interest in the Franchised Business or in Franchisee to a third party approved by Franchisor. Such transfers, including transfers by will or inheritance, shall be subject to the conditions for assignments and transfers contained in this Agreement. During such one hundred eighty (180) day period, the Franchised Business must remain at all times under the primary management of a Designated Manager who otherwise meets Franchisor&rsquo;s management qualifications.</p>

<p> Following such a death or Incapacity of such person as described in this Section 18.6, if necessary in Franchisor&rsquo;s discretion, Franchisor shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assume operation of the Franchised Business until the deceased or incapacitated owner&rsquo;s interest is transferred to a third party approved by Franchisor. Franchisor shall be given access to the Franchised Business, even if located within Franchisee&rsquo;s or its Designated Manager&rsquo;s principal residence, and shall not be held liable for trespass or any related tort. Franchisor may charge a management fee as stated in the Operations Manual from time to time, currently equal to $250 per person per day, and Franchisor shall be entitled to reimbursement of any expenses Franchisor incurs that are not paid out of the operating cash flow of the Franchised Business.</p>

<p>19. RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL</p>

<p>19.1 Submission of Offer</p>

<p> If Franchisee, or any of its owners, proposes to sell or otherwise transfer (including a transfer by death or Incapacity according to Section 18.6) the Franchised Business (or any of its assets outside of the normal course of business), any ownership interest in Franchisee or any ownership interest in the Franchise granted hereunder, Franchisee shall obtain and deliver a bona fide, executed written offer or proposal to purchase, along with all pertinent documents including any contract or due diligence materials, to Franchisor, except with regards to a sale or transfer to a family member. The offer must apply only to an approved sale of the assets or interests listed above and may not include any other property or rights of Franchisee or any of its owners.</p>

<p>19.2 Franchisor&rsquo;s Right to Purchase</p>

<p> Franchisor shall, for thirty (30) days from the date of delivery of all such documents, have the right, exercisable by written notice to Franchisee, to purchase the offered assets or interest for the price and on the same terms and conditions contained in such offer communicated to Franchisee. Franchisor has the right to substitute cash for the fair market value of any form of payment proposed in such offer. Franchisor&rsquo;s credit shall be deemed at least equal to the credit of any proposed buyer. After providing notice to Franchisee of Franchisor&rsquo;s intent to exercise this right of first refusal, Franchisor shall have up to sixty (60) days to close the purchase. Franchisor shall be entitled to receive from Franchisee all customary representations and warranties given by Franchisee as the seller of the assets or such ownership interest or, at Franchisor&rsquo;s election, such representations and warranties contained in the proposal.</p>

<p>19.3 Non-Exercise of Right of First Refusal</p>

<p> If Franchisor does not exercise its right of first refusal within thirty (30) days from the date of delivery of all such documents, the offer or proposal may be accepted by Franchisee or any of its owners, subject to Franchisor&rsquo;s prior written approval as required by Section 18.2. Should the sale fail to close within 120 days after the offer is delivered to Franchisor, Franchisor&rsquo;s right of first refusal shall renew and be implemented in accordance with this Section.</p>

<p>19.4 Sales or Transfers to Family Excepted</p>

<p> If Franchisee proposes to sell or otherwise transfer the Franchised Business (or any of its assets outside of the normal course of business), any ownership interest in Franchisee or any ownership interest in the Franchise granted hereunder to a member of Franchisee&rsquo;s (or its owners&rsquo;) family, then the terms and conditions of this Section shall be inapplicable. Nothing in this Section 19.4 shall be construed to relieve Franchisee from full compliance with the terms and conditions of Section 18.2 prior to a sale or transfer to family according to this Section.</p>

<p>20. BENEFICIAL OWNERS OF FRANCHISEE</p>

<p> Franchisee represents, and Franchisor enters into this Agreement in reliance upon such representation, that the individual(s) identified in Schedule 6 is/are the sole holder(s) of a legal or beneficial interest (in the stated percentages) of Franchisee.</p>

<p>21. RELATIONSHIP AND INDEMNIFICATION</p>

<p>21.1 Relationship</p>

<p> This Agreement is purely a contractual relationship between the parties and does not appoint or make Franchisee an agent, legal representative, joint-venturer, partner, employee, servant, or independent contractor of Franchisor for any purpose whatsoever. Franchisee may not represent or imply to third parties that Franchisee is an agent of Franchisor, and Franchisee is in no way authorized to make any contract, agreement, warranty, or representation on behalf of Franchisor, or to create any obligation, express or implied, on Franchisor&rsquo;s behalf. During the term of this Agreement, and any extension or renewal hereof, Franchisee shall hold itself out to the public only as a franchisee and an owner of the Franchised Business operating the Franchised Business according to a franchise from Franchisor. Franchisee shall take such affirmative action as may be necessary to do so including, without limitation, exhibiting a notice of that fact in a conspicuous place on all forms, stationery or other written materials, the content of which Franchisor has the right to specify. Under no circumstances shall Franchisor be liable for any act, omission, contract, debt, nor any other obligation of Franchisee. Franchisor shall in no way be responsible for any injuries to persons or property resulting from the operation of the Franchised Business by Franchisee. Any third-party contractors and vendors retained by Franchisee to convert or construct the premises are independent contractors of Franchisee alone.</p>

<p>21.2 Standard of Care</p>

<p> This Agreement does not establish a fiduciary relationship between the parties.</p>

<p>21.3 Indemnification</p>

<p> Franchisee shall hold harmless and indemnify Franchisor, any Affiliate, all holders of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisor and all officers, directors, executives, managers, members, partners, owners, employees, agents, successors and assigns (collectively &ldquo;Franchisor Indemnities&rdquo;) from and against all losses, damages, fines, costs, expenses or liability (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and all other costs of litigation) incurred in connection with any action, suit, demand, claim, investigation or proceeding, or any settlement thereof, which arises from or is based upon Franchisee&rsquo;s (a) ownership or operation of the Franchised Business; (b) violation, breach or asserted violation or breach of any federal, state or local law, regulation or rule; (c) breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or provision of this Agreement or any other agreement between Franchisee and Franchisor (or an Affiliate); (d) defamation of Franchisor or the System; (e) acts, errors or omissions committed or incurred in connection with the Franchised Business; or (f) infringement, violation or alleged infringement or violation of any Mark, patent or copyright or any misuse of the Trade Secrets or other Confidential Information. The obligations of this Section 21.3 shall expressly survive the termination of this Agreement.</p>

<p>21.4 Right to Retain Counsel</p>

<p> Franchisee shall give Franchisor immediate notice of any such action, suit, demand, claim, investigation, or proceeding that may give rise to a claim for indemnification by a Franchisor Indemnity. Franchisor has the right to retain counsel of its own choosing in connection with any such action, suit, demand, claim, investigation or proceeding. In order to protect persons, property, Franchisor&rsquo;s reputation or the goodwill of others, Franchisor has the right to, at any time without notice, take such remedial or corrective actions as it deems expedient with respect to any action, suit, demand, claim, investigation or proceeding if, in Franchisor&rsquo;s sole judgment, there are grounds to believe any of the acts or circumstances listed above have occurred. If Franchisor&rsquo;s exercise of its rights under this Section causes any of Franchisee&rsquo;s insurers to refuse to pay a third-party claim, all cause of action and legal remedies Franchisee might have against such insurer shall automatically be assigned to Franchisor without the need for any further action on either party&rsquo;s part. Under no circumstances shall Franchisor be required or obligated to seek coverage from third parties or otherwise mitigate losses in order to maintain a claim against Franchisee. The failure to pursue such remedy or mitigate such loss shall in no way reduce the amounts recoverable by Franchisor from Franchisee. Franchisee agrees to not be a party to class action suit against the Franchisor or any of its Affiliates under any circumstances.</p>

<p>22. GENERAL CONDITIONS AND PROVISIONS</p>

<p>22.1 No Waiver</p>

<p> No failure of Franchisor to exercise any power reserved to it hereunder, or to insist upon strict compliance by Franchisee with any obligation or condition hereunder, and no custom nor practice of the parties in variance with the terms hereof, shall constitute a waiver of Franchisor&rsquo;s right to demand exact compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Waiver by Franchisor of any particular default by Franchisee shall not be binding unless in writing and executed by Franchisor and shall not affect nor impair Franchisor&rsquo;s right with respect to any subsequent default of the same or of a different nature. Subsequent acceptance by Franchisor of any payment(s) due shall not be deemed to be a waiver by Franchisor of any preceding breach by Franchisee of any terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement.</p>

<p>22.2 Injunctive Relief</p>

<p> As any breach by Franchisee of any of the restrictions contained in Sections 6, 7, and 17 would result in irreparable injury to Franchisor, and as the damages arising out of any such breach would be difficult to ascertain, in addition to all other remedies provided by law or in equity, Franchisor shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief (whether a restraining order, a preliminary injunction or a permanent injunction) against any such breach, whether actual or contemplated, without the necessity of posting security or bond and Franchisee shall be responsible for Franchisor&rsquo;s reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees incurred in pursuing the same. Franchisor&rsquo;s right to seek injunctive relief will not affect the parties&rsquo; waiver of jury trial and covenant to arbitrate all disputes in accordance with Section 23.7. Franchisor&rsquo;s rights herein shall include pursuing injunctive relief through arbitration or in a state or federal court.</p>

<p>22.3 Notices</p>

<p> All notices required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed received: (a) at the time delivered by hand to the recipient party (or to an officer, director or partner of the recipient party); (b) on the next business day after transmission by facsimile or other reasonably reliable electronic communication system; (c) two (2) business days after being sent via guaranteed overnight delivery by a commercial courier service; or (d) five (5) business days after being sent by Registered Mail, return receipt requested. Either party may change its address by a written notice sent in accordance with this Section 22.3. All notices, payments and reports required by this Agreement shall be sent to Franchisor at the following address, or at such other address as Franchisor may provide:</p>

<p> Our Maids Franchise, Inc.  Attn.: Antonio Moreno  8 The Green, Suite 14095  Dover, DE 19901</p>

<p>22.4 Cost of Enforcement or Defense</p>

<p> If Franchisor is required to enforce this Agreement in a judicial or arbitration proceeding, if it is the prevailing party, it shall be entitled to reimbursement of its costs, including reasonable accounting and attorneys&rsquo; fees, in connection with such proceeding.</p>

<p>22.5 Unlimited Guaranty and Assumption of Obligations</p>

<p> All holders of a legal or beneficial interest in Franchisee of five percent (5%) or greater shall be required to execute, as of the date of this Agreement, the Unlimited Guaranty and Assumption of Obligations attached as Schedule 3, through which such holders agree to assume and discharge all of Franchisee&rsquo;s obligations under this Agreement and to be personally liable hereunder for all of the same.</p>

<p>22.6 Approvals</p>

<p> Whenever this Agreement requires the prior approval or consent of Franchisor, Franchisee shall make a timely written request to Franchisor for such approval and, except as otherwise provided herein, any approval or consent granted shall be effective only if in writing. Franchisor makes no warranties or guarantees upon which Franchisee may rely, and assumes no liability or obligation to Franchisee or any third party to which it would not otherwise be subject, by providing any waiver, approval, advice, consent or services to Franchisee in connection with this Agreement, or by reason of any neglect, delay or denial of any request for approval.</p>

<p>22.7 Entire Agreement</p>

<p> This Agreement and all exhibits to this Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties and supersede any and all prior negotiations, understandings, representations, and agreements. Nothing in this or in any related agreement, however, is intended to disclaim the representations we made in the franchise disclosure document that we furnished to you. No amendment, change or variance from this Agreement shall be binding on either party unless executed in writing by both parties.</p>

<p>22.8 Severability and Modification</p>

<p> Except as noted below, each paragraph, part, term and provision of this Agreement shall be considered severable. If any paragraph, part, term or provision herein is ruled to be unenforceable, unreasonable or invalid, such ruling shall not impair the operation of or affect the remaining portions, paragraphs, parts, terms and provisions of this Agreement, and the latter shall continue to be given full force and effect and bind the parties; and such unenforceable, unreasonable or invalid paragraphs, parts, terms or provisions shall be deemed not part of this Agreement.</p>

<p> Notwithstanding the above, each of the covenants contained in Sections 7 and 17 shall be construed as independent of any other covenant or provision of this Agreement. If all or any portion of any such covenant is held to be unenforceable, unreasonable, or invalid, then it shall be amended to provide for limitations on disclosure of Trade Secrets or other Confidential Information or on competition to the maximum extent provided or permitted by law.</p>

<p>22.9 Construction</p>

<p> All captions herein are intended solely for the convenience of the parties, and none shall be deemed to affect the meaning or construction of any provision hereof.</p>

<p>22.10 Force Majeure</p>

<p> Whenever a period of time is provided in this Agreement for either party to perform any act, except pay monies, neither party shall be liable nor responsible for any delays due to strikes, lockouts, casualties, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental regulation or control or other causes beyond the reasonable control of the parties, and the time period for the performance of such act shall be extended for the amount of time of the delay. This clause shall not result in an extension of the term of this Agreement.</p>

<p>22.11 Timing</p>

<p> Time is of the essence. Except as in Section 22.10, failure to perform any act within the time required or permitted by this Agreement shall be a material breach.</p>

<p>22.12 Withholding Payments</p>

<p> Franchisee shall not, for any reason, withhold payment of any Royalty Fees or other amounts due to Franchisor or to an Affiliate. Franchisee shall not withhold or offset any amounts, damages or other monies allegedly due to Franchisee against any amounts due to Franchisor. No endorsement or statement on any payment for less than the full amount due to Franchisor will be construed as an acknowledgment of payment in full, or an accord and satisfaction, and Franchisor has the right to accept and cash any such payment without prejudice to Franchisor&rsquo;s right to recover the full amount due, or pursue any other remedy provided in this Agreement or by law. Franchisor has the right to apply any payments made by Franchisee against any of Franchisee&rsquo;s past due indebtedness as Franchisor deems appropriate. Franchisor shall set off sums Franchisor owes to Franchisee against any unpaid debts owed by Franchisee to Franchisor.</p>

<p>22.13 Further Assurances</p>

<p> Each party to this Agreement will execute and deliver such further instruments, contracts, forms or other documents, and will perform such further acts, as may be necessary or desirable to perform or complete any term, covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement.</p>

<p>22.14 Third Party Beneficiaries</p>

<p> Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, nothing in this Agreement is intended, nor shall be deemed, to confer upon any person or legal entity other than Franchisor or Franchisee, and their respective successors and assigns as may be contemplated by this Agreement, any rights or remedies under this Agreement.</p>

<p>22.15 Multiple Originals</p>

<p> Both parties will execute multiple copies of this Agreement, and each executed copy will be deemed an original.</p>

<p>23. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</p>

<p>23.1 Choice of Law</p>

<p> Except as to claims governed by federal law, Delaware law governs all claims that in any way relate to or arise out of this Agreement or any of the dealings of the parties (&ldquo;Claims&rdquo;). However, no laws regulating the sale of franchises or governing the relationship between franchisor and franchisee shall apply unless the jurisdictional requirements of such laws are met independently of this paragraph.</p>

<p>23.2 Jurisdiction and Venue</p>

<p> You and we agree that venue and jurisdiction for any Claims, except those required to be submitted to arbitration, shall be proper solely in the state and federal court nearest to our corporate headquarters, presently located in Dover, Delaware. However, if you are an Illinois, Maryland, or Washington State resident or your franchise territory is located in Illinois, Maryland, or Washington State, you agree to bring any Claims, if at all, solely in arbitration before the American Arbitration Association in the city or county where our corporate headquarters are located.</p>

<p>23.3 Jury Waiver</p>

<p> In any trial between any of the parties as to any Claims, you and we agree to waive our rights to a jury trial and instead have such action tried by a judge.</p>

<p>23.4 Class Action Waiver</p>

<p> You agree to bring any Claims, if at all, individually and you shall not join such claim with claims of any other person or entity or bring, join or participate in a class action against us.</p>

<p>23.5 Limitation of Damages</p>

<p> Franchisee and Franchisor each waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any right or claim for any punitive or exemplary damages against the other and agree that if there is a dispute with the other, each will be limited to the recovery of actual damages sustained by it including reasonable accounting and legal fees as provided in Section 22.4. Franchisee waives and disclaims any right to consequential damages in any action or claim against Franchisor concerning this Agreement or any related agreement. In any claim or action brought by Franchisee against Franchisor concerning this Agreement, Franchisee&rsquo;s contract damages shall not exceed and shall be limited to refund of Franchisee&rsquo;s Franchise Fee and Royalty Fees.</p>

<p>23.6 Limitation of Actions  You agree to bring any Claims against us, if at all, within one (1) year of the occurrence of the facts giving rise to such Claims, and that any action not brought within this period shall be barred as a claim, counterclaim, defense, or set-off.</p>

<p>23.7 Prior Notice of Claims</p>

<p> As a condition precedent to commencing an action for a Claim, you must notify us within thirty (30) days after the occurrence of the violation or breach, and failure to timely give such notice shall preclude any claim for damages.</p>

<p>23.8 Internal Dispute Resolution</p>

<p> You must first bring any Claim to our CEO, after providing notice as in Section 23.7 above. You must exhaust this internal dispute resolution procedure before you may bring your Claim before a third party.</p>

<p>23.9 Mediation and Arbitration</p>

<p> Before you may bring any Claim against us, you agree to try for a period of 60 days to mediate such claim before a mutually agreed to mediator in the city or county where our headquarters are located. If we cannot mutually agree on a mediator, you and we agree to use the mediation services of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), and split any AAA and mediator fees equally.</p>

<p> If mediation is unsuccessful and you decide to pursue a legal claim against us, you agree to bring such claim solely in binding arbitration conducted in the city or county where our headquarters is located, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. The proceedings will be held by a single arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding upon the parties. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having personal and subject matter jurisdiction.</p>

<p>23.10 Waiver of Bond</p>

<p>You agree that if we are forced to bring suit to enforce any provision of this Agreement, you agree to waive any requirement that we post bond to obtain a temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunction to enforce these duties.</p>

<p>23.11 Attorney Fees</p>

<p> If we are the substantially prevailing party as to any Claims, you agree to reimburse our costs and attorney fees incurred in pursuing or defending the Claims.</p>

<p>23.12 Third Party Beneficiaries</p>

<p>Our officers, directors, members, shareholders, agents, and employees are express third-party beneficiaries of the terms of the Dispute Resolution provisions contained herein.</p>

<p> Title:   __ SCHEDULE 2 TO THE FRANCHISE AGREEMENT NONDISCLOSURE AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT</p>

<p> This &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo; made as of the  _ day of     _, 20 _, is by and between      , (&ldquo;Franchisee,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us,&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) and        (&ldquo;Individual,&rdquo; &ldquo;you,&rdquo; or &ldquo;your&rdquo;).</p>

<p>W I T N E S S E T H:</p>

<p> WHEREAS, Franchisee is a party to that certain Franchise Agreement dated      , 20__ (&ldquo;Franchise Agreement&rdquo;) by and between Franchisee and the Franchisor, Our Maids Franchise, Inc. (&ldquo;Company&rdquo;); and</p>

<p> WHEREAS, Franchisee desires Individual to have access to and review certain Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information, which are more particularly described below; and</p>

<p> WHEREAS, Franchisee is required by the Franchise Agreement to have Individual execute this Agreement prior to providing Individual access to said Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information; and   WHEREAS, Individual understands the necessity of not disclosing any such information to any other party or using such information to compete against Company, Franchisee or any other franchisee of Company in any business (i) that offers or provides (or grants franchises or licenses to others to operate a business that offers or provides) products and services the same as or similar to those provided by Franchisee or (ii) in which Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information (as defined below) could be used to the disadvantage of Franchisee, or Company, any affiliate of Company or Company&rsquo;s other franchisees (hereinafter, &ldquo;Competitive Business&rdquo;); provided, however, that the term &ldquo;Competitive Business&rdquo; shall not apply to any business operated by Franchisee under a Franchise Agreement with Company.</p>

<p> NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and undertakings stated here, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereby mutually agree as follows:</p>

<p> 1. Trade Secrets and Confidential Information</p>

<p> Individual understands Franchisee possesses and will possess Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information that are important to its business.</p>

<p> a) For the purposes of this Agreement, a &ldquo;Trade Secret&rdquo; is information in any form (including, but not limited to, materials and techniques, technical or non-technical data, formulas, patterns, recipes compilations, programs, devices, methods, techniques, drawings, processes, financial data, financial plans, product plans, passwords, lists of actual or potential customers or suppliers) related to or used in the Our Maids Business that is not commonly known by or available to the public and that information: (i) derives economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (ii) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.</p>

<p> b) For the purposes of this Agreement &ldquo;Confidential Information&rdquo; means technical and non-technical information used in or related to Our Maids that is not commonly known by or available to the public, including, without limitation, Trade Secrets and information contained in the Operations Manual and training guides and materials. In addition, any other information identified as confidential when delivered by Franchisee shall be deemed Confidential Information. Confidential Information shall not include, however, any information that: (i) is now or subsequently becomes generally available to the public through no fault of Individual; (ii) Individual can demonstrate was rightfully in its possession, without obligation of nondisclosure, prior to disclosure according to this Agreement; (iii) is independently developed without the use of any Confidential Information; or (iv) is rightfully obtained from a third party who has the right, without obligation of nondisclosure, to transfer or disclose such information.</p>

<p> c) Any information expressly designated by Company or Franchisee as &ldquo;Trade Secrets&rdquo; or &ldquo;Confidential Information&rdquo; shall be deemed such for all purposes of this Agreement, but the absence of designation shall not relieve Individual of his or her obligations hereunder in respect of information otherwise constituting Trade Secrets or Confidential Information. Individual understands Franchisee&rsquo;s providing of access to the Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information creates a relationship of confidence and trust between Individual and Franchisee with respect to the Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information.</p>

<p> 2. Confidentiality/Non-Disclosure</p>

<p> a) Individual shall not communicate or divulge to (or use for the benefit of) any other person, firm, association, or corporation, with the sole exception of Franchisee, now or at any time in the future, any Trade Secrets or other Confidential Information. At all times from the date of this Agreement, Individual must take all steps reasonably necessary and/or requested by Franchisee to ensure that the Confidential Information and Trade Secrets are kept confidential according to the terms of this Agreement. Individual must comply with all applicable policies, procedures and practices that Franchisee has established and may establish from time to time with regard to the Confidential Information and Trade Secrets.</p>

<p> b) Individual&rsquo;s obligations under paragraph 2(a) of this Agreement shall continue in effect after termination of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee, regardless of the reason or reasons for termination, and whether such termination is voluntary or involuntary, and Franchisee is entitled to communicate Individual&rsquo;s obligations under this Agreement to any future customer or employer to the extent deemed necessary by Franchisee for protection of its rights hereunder and regardless of whether Individual or any of its affiliates or assigns becomes an investor, partner, joint venturer, broker, distributor or the like in an Our Maids Business.</p>

<p> 3. Non-Competition</p>

<p> a) During the term of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee and for a period of two (2) years after the expiration or termination of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee, regardless of the cause of expiration or termination, Individual shall not, directly or indirectly, divert or attempt to divert any business or customer of Franchisee or the Company to any Competitive Business, by direct or indirect inducement or otherwise, or do or perform, directly or indirectly, any other act injurious or prejudicial to the goodwill associated with the Company&rsquo;s service mark &ldquo;Our Maids&rdquo; and such other trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, designs, graphics, logos, emblems, insignia, fascia, slogans, drawings and other commercial symbols as the Company designates to be used in connection with Our Maids or the Company&rsquo;s uniform standards, methods, procedures and specifications for the establishment and operation of an Our Maids business.     b) During the term of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, regardless of the cause of termination, Individual shall not, directly or indirectly, offer Competitive Business services anywhere within a TWENTY FIVE (25) mile radius of any Our Maids location without the express written consent of Franchisee and the Company.</p>

<p> c) During the term of Individual&rsquo;s relationship with Franchisee and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, regardless of the cause of termination, Individual shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit or otherwise attempt to induce or influence any business associate of Franchisee, Company or any other Our Maids Business to compete against, or terminate or modify his, her or its business relationship with, Franchisee, Company or any other Our Maids Business.</p>

<p> 4. Reasonableness of Restrictions</p>

<p> Individual acknowledges that each of the terms stated here, including the restrictive covenants, is fair and reasonable and is reasonably required for the protection of Franchisee, Company, and Company&rsquo;s Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information, the Company&rsquo;s business system, network of franchises and trade and service marks, and Individual waives any right to challenge these restrictions as being overly broad, unreasonable or otherwise unenforceable. If, however, a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any such restriction is unreasonable or unenforceable, then Individual shall submit to the reduction of any such activity, time period or geographic restriction necessary to enable the court to enforce such restrictions to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. It is the desire and intent of the parties that the provisions of this Agreement shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies applied in any jurisdiction where enforcement is sought.</p>

<p> 5. Relief for Breaches of Confidentiality, Non-Solicitation, and Non-Competition</p>

<p> Individual further acknowledges that an actual or threatened violation of the covenants contained in this Agreement will cause Franchisee and Company immediate and irreparable harm, damage and injury that cannot be fully compensated for by an award of damages or other remedies at law. Accordingly, Franchisee and/or Company shall be entitled, as a matter of right, to an injunction from any court of competent jurisdiction restraining any further violation by Individual of this Agreement without any requirement to show any actual damage or to post any bond or other security. Such right to an injunction shall be cumulative and in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights and remedies that Franchisee and Company may have at law or in equity.</p>

<p> 6. Dispute Resolution</p>

<p> a) Choice of Law. Except as to claims governed by federal law, the local law where the Franchised Business is located governs all claims that in any way relate to or arise out of this Agreement or any of the dealings of the parties (&ldquo;Claims&rdquo;). However, no laws regulating the sale of franchises or governing the relationship between franchisor and franchisee shall apply unless the jurisdictional requirements of such laws are met independently of this paragraph.</p>

<p> b) Jurisdiction and Venue. You and we agree that venue and jurisdiction for any Claims, except those required to be submitted to arbitration, shall be proper solely in the state and federal court nearest to our corporate headquarters.</p>

<p> c) Jury Waiver. In any trial between any of the parties as to any Claims, you and we agree to waive our rights to a jury trial and instead have such action tried by a judge.</p>

<p> d) Class Action Waiver. You agree to bring any Claims, if at all, individually and you shall not join such claim with claims of any other person or entity or bring, join or participate in a class action against us.  e) Punitive Damages Waiver. As to any Claims, you and we agree to waive our rights, if any, to seek or recover punitive damages.</p>

<p> f) Limitation of Actions. You agree to bring any Claims against us, if at all, within one (1) year of the occurrence of the facts giving rise to such Claims, and that any action not brought within this period shall be barred as a claim, counterclaim, defense, or set-off.</p>

<p>g) Prior Notice of Claims. As a condition precedent to commencing an action for a Claim, you must notify us within thirty (30) days after the occurrence of the violation or breach, and failure to timely give such notice shall preclude any claim for damages.</p>

<p>h) Internal Dispute Resolution. You must first bring any Claim to our CEO, after providing notice as in Section 6(g) above. You must exhaust this internal dispute resolution procedure before you may bring your Claim before a third party.</p>

<p> i) Mediation and Arbitration. Before you may bring any Claim against us court, you agree to try for a period of 60 days to mediate such claim before a mutually agreed to mediator in the city or county where our headquarters are located. If we cannot mutually agree on a mediator, you and we agree to use the mediation services of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), and split any AAA and mediator fees equally.</p>

<p> If mediation is unsuccessful and you decide to pursue a legal claim against us, you agree to bring such claim solely in binding arbitration conducted in the city or county of our headquarters in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. The proceedings will be held by a single arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding upon the parties. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having personal and subject matter jurisdiction.</p>

<p>j) Waiver of Bond. You agree that if we are forced to bring suit to enforce any provision of this Agreement, you agree to waive any requirement that we post bond to obtain a temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunction to enforce these duties.</p>

<p>k) Attorney Fees. If we are the substantially prevailing party as to any Claims, you agree to reimburse our costs and attorney fees incurred in pursuing or defending the Claims.</p>

<p> 7. Miscellaneous</p>

<p> a) This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement supersedes any prior agreements, negotiations and discussions between Individual and Franchisee. This Agreement cannot be altered or amended except by an agreement in writing signed by the duly authorized representatives of the parties.</p>

<p> b) This Agreement shall be effective as of the date this Agreement is executed and shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of Individual and shall inure to the benefit of Franchisee, its subsidiaries, successors and assigns. Company is an intended third-party beneficiary of this Agreement with the independent right to enforce the confidentiality and non-competition provisions contained herein.</p>

<p> c) The failure of either party to insist upon performance in any one (1) or more instances upon performance of any terms and conditions of this Agreement shall not be construed a waiver of future performance of any such term, covenant or condition of this Agreement and the obligations of either party with respect thereto shall continue in full force and effect.</p>

<p> d) In the event that any part of this Agreement shall be held to be unenforceable or invalid, the remaining parts hereof shall nevertheless continue to be valid and enforceable as though the invalid portions were not a part hereof.</p>

<p> e) This Agreement may be modified or amended only by a written instrument duly executed by Individual, Franchisee and Company.</p>

<p> f) The existence of any claim or cause of action Individual might have against Franchisee or Company will not constitute a defense to the enforcement by Franchisee or Company of this Agreement.</p>

<p> INDIVIDUAL CERTIFIES THAT HE OR SHE HAS READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY, AND UNDERSTANDS AND ACCEPTS THE OBLIGATIONS THAT IT IMPOSES WITHOUT RESERVATION. NO PROMISES OR REPRESENTATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO SUCH PERSON TO INDUCE THE SIGNING OF THIS AGREEMENT.</p>

<p> THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE COMPANY IS A THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT THE COMPANY SHALL BE ENTITLED TO ENFORCE THIS AGREEMENT WITHOUT THE COOPERATION OF THE FRANCHISEE.

<p>1. Use. Tenant is a franchisee of Franchisor. The Leased Premises shall be used only for the operation of an Our Maids business (or any name authorized by Franchisor).</p>

<p>2. Notice of Default and Opportunity To Cure. Landlord shall provide Franchisor with copies of any written notice of default (&ldquo;Default&rdquo;) given to Tenant under the Lease, and Landlord grants to Franchisor the option (but not the obligation) to cure any Default under the Lease (should Tenant fail to do so) within 10 days after the expiration of the period in which Tenant may cure the Default.</p>

<p>3. Termination of Lease. Landlord shall copy Franchisor on any notice of termination of the Lease. If Landlord terminates the Lease for Tenant&rsquo;s Default, Franchisor shall have the option to enter into a new Lease with Landlord on the same terms and conditions as the terminated Lease, subject to Landlord&rsquo;s approval in its reasonable discretion. To exercise this option, Franchisor must notify Landlord within 10 days after Franchisor receives notice of the termination of the Lease.</p>

<p>4. Termination of Franchise Agreement. If the Franchise Agreement between Franchisor and Tenant is terminated during the term of the Lease, then upon the written request of Franchisor, Landlord and Tenant consent to allow Franchisor to assume any existing term of the Lease (the &ldquo;Assumption&rdquo;), provided that any and all defaults have been cured and all payments due under the Lease are current, and to enter into a written agreement providing for such Assumption. In the event of an Assumption, Landlord will deliver possession of the Leased Premises to Franchisor free and clear of any rights of the Tenant or any third party. Landlord further consents to give Franchisor the right, following the Assumption, to assign its interest in the Lease or to sublet the Leased Premises to another franchisee of Franchisor with reasonable consent from the Landlord.</p>

<p>5. Assignment and Subletting. Notwithstanding any provision of the Lease to the contrary, Tenant shall have the right to assign or sublet the Lease to Franchisor, provided that no such assignment or sublease shall relieve Tenant or any guarantor of liability under the Lease. If Franchisor becomes the lessee of the Leased Premises, then Franchisor shall have the right to assign or sublease its lease to a franchisee of Franchisor&rsquo;s brand, subject to Landlord&rsquo;s approval in its reasonable discretion.</p>

<p>6. Authorization. Tenant authorizes Landlord and Franchisor to communicate directly with each other about Tenant and Tenant&rsquo;s business.</p>

<p> 1. Any claims arising under the Maryland Franchise Registration and Disclosure Law must be brought within 3 years after the grant of the franchise.</p>

<p> 2. A general release required as a condition of renewal, sale, and/or assignment/transfer shall not apply to any liability under the Maryland Franchise Registration and Disclosure Law.</p>

<p>If any of the terms of the Franchise Agreement are inconsistent with the terms below, the terms below control.</p>

<p>Minn. Stat. &sect;80C.21 and Minn. Rule 2860.4400(J) prohibit the franchisor from requiring litigation to be conducted outside Minnesota, requiring waiver of a jury trial, or requiring the franchisee to consent to liquidated damages, termination penalties or judgment notes. In addition, nothing in the Franchise Disclosure Document or agreements can abrogate or reduce (1) any of the franchisee&rsquo;s rights as provided for in Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 80C, or (2) franchisee&rsquo;s rights to any procedure, forum, or remedies provided for by the laws of the jurisdiction.</p>

<p>With respect to franchises governed by Minnesota law, the franchisor will comply with Minn. Stat. Sec. 80C.14 Subds. 3, 4, and 5 which require (except in certain specified cases), that a franchisee be given 90 days&rsquo; notice of termination (with 60 days to cure) and 180 days&rsquo; notice for non-renewal of the franchise agreement and that consent to the transfer of the franchise will not be unreasonably withheld.</p>

<p>Minnesota considers it unfair to not protect the franchisee&rsquo;s right to use the trademarks. Refer to Minnesota Statutes 80C.12, Subd. 1(g).</p>

<p>Minnesota Rules 2860.4400(D) prohibits a franchisor from requiring a franchisee to assent to a general release.</p>

<p>The franchisee cannot consent to the franchisor obtaining injunctive relief. The franchisor may seek injunctive relief. See Minn. Rules 2860.4400J.</p>

<p>Also, a court will determine if a bond is required.</p>

<p>Any Limitations of Claims section must comply with Minnesota Statutes, Section 80C.17, Subd. 5.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON ADDENDUM TO THE FRANCHISE AGREEMENT</p>

<p>If any of the terms of the Franchise Agreement are inconsistent with the terms below, the terms below control.</p>

<p>In the event of a conflict of laws, the provisions of the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, Chapter 19.100 RCW will prevail.</p>

<p>RCW 19.100.180 may supersede the franchise agreement in your relationship with the franchisor including the areas of termination and renewal of your franchise. There may also be court decisions which may supersede the franchise agreement in your relationship with the franchisor including the areas of termination and renewal of your franchise.</p>

<p>In any arbitration or mediation involving a franchise purchased in Washington, the arbitration or mediation site will be either in the state of Washington, or in a place mutually agreed upon at the time of the arbitration or mediation, or as determined by the arbitrator or mediator at the time of arbitration or mediation. In addition, if litigation is not precluded by the franchise agreement, a franchisee may bring an action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with the sale of franchises, or a violation of the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, in Washington.</p>

<p>A release or waiver of rights executed by a franchisee may not include rights under the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act or any rule or order thereunder except when executed pursuant to a negotiated settlement after the agreement is in effect and where the parties are represented by independent counsel. Provisions such as those which unreasonably restrict or limit the statute of limitations period for claims under the Act, or rights or remedies under the Act such as a right to a jury trial, may not be enforceable.</p>

<p>Transfer fees are collectable to the extent that they reflect the franchisor&rsquo;s reasonable estimated or actual costs in effecting a transfer.</p>

<p>Pursuant to RCW 49.62.020, a noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable against an employee, including an employee of a franchisee, unless the employee&rsquo;s earnings from the party seeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed $100,000 per year (an amount that will be adjusted annually for inflation). In addition, a noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable against an independent contractor of a franchisee under RCW 49.62.030 unless the independent contractor&rsquo;s earnings from the party seeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed $250,000 per year (an amount that will be adjusted annually for inflation). As a result, any provisions contained in the franchise agreement or elsewhere that conflict with these limitations are void and unenforceable in Washington.</p>

<p>RCW 49.62.060 prohibits a franchisor from restricting, restraining, or prohibiting a franchisee from (i) soliciting or hiring any employee of a franchisee of the same franchisor or (ii) soliciting or hiring any employee of the franchisor. As a result, any such provisions contained in the franchise agreement or elsewhere are void and unenforceable in Washington.</p>

<p>Section 17.2.2(a) is modified to also provide that the post-term non-compete will only apply to a 25 mile radius of your Franchised Business.</p>

<p>Section 21.3 is modified to also provide that the indemnification does not extend to liabilities resulting from the gross negligence of willful misconduct of any Franchisor indemnitee.</p>

<p> MINNESOTA ADDENDUM TO THE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT</p>

<p>As to franchises governed by the Minnesota franchise laws, if any of the terms of the Disclosure Document are inconsistent with the terms below, the terms below control.</p>

<p>Minn. Stat. &sect;80C.21 and Minn. Rule 2860.4400(J) prohibit the franchisor from requiring litigation to be conducted outside Minnesota, requiring waiver of a jury trial, or requiring the franchisee to consent to liquidated damages, termination penalties or judgment notes. In addition, nothing in the Franchise Disclosure Document or agreements can abrogate or reduce (1) any of the franchisee&rsquo;s rights as provided for in Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 80C, or (2) franchisee&rsquo;s rights to any procedure, forum, or remedies provided for by the laws of the jurisdiction.</p>

<p>With respect to franchises governed by Minnesota law, the franchisor will comply with Minn. Stat. Sec. 80C.14 Subds. 3, 4, and 5 which require (except in certain specified cases), that a franchisee be given 90 days&rsquo; notice of termination (with 60 days to cure) and 180 days&rsquo; notice for non-renewal of the franchise agreement and that consent to the transfer of the franchise will not be unreasonably withheld.</p>

<p>The franchisor will protect the franchisee&rsquo;s rights to use the trademarks, service marks, trade names, logotypes or other commercial symbols or indemnify the franchisee from any loss, costs or expenses arising out of any claim, suit or demand regarding the use of the name.</p>

<p>Minnesota considers it unfair to not protect the franchisee&rsquo;s right to use the trademarks. Refer to Minnesota Statutes 80C.12, Subd. 1(g).</p>

<p>Minnesota Rules 2860.4400(D) prohibits a franchisor from requiring a franchisee to assent to a general release.</p>

<p>The franchisee cannot consent to the franchisor obtaining injunctive relief. The franchisor may seek injunctive relief. See Minn. Rules 2860.4400J.</p>

<p>Also, a court will determine if a bond is required.</p>

<p>The Limitations of Claims section must comply with Minnesota Statutes, Section 80C.17, Subd. 5.</p>

<p> D. No such party is subject to a currently effective injunctive or restrictive order or decree relating to the franchise, or under a Federal, State or Canadian franchise, securities, antitrust, trade regulation or trade practice law, resulting from a concluded or pending action or proceeding brought by a public agency, or is subject to any currently effective order of any national securities association or national securities exchange, as defined in the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, suspending or expelling such person from membership in such association or exchange; or is subject to a currently effective injunctive or restrictive order relating to any other business activity as a result of an action brought by a public agency or department, including, without limitation, actions affecting a license as a real estate broker or sales agent.</p>

<p> 3. The following is added to the end of the &ldquo;Summary&rdquo; sections of Item 17(c), titled &ldquo;Requirements for franchisee to renew or extend,&rdquo; and Item 17(m), entitled &ldquo;Conditions for franchisor approval of transfer&rdquo;:</p>

<p>However, to the extent required by applicable law, all rights you enjoy and any causes of action arising in your favor from the provisions of Article 33 of the General Business Law of the State of New York and the regulations issued thereunder shall remain in force; it being the intent of this proviso that the non-waiver provisions of General Business Law Sections 687.4 and 687.5 be satisfied.</p>

<p>4. The following language replaces the &ldquo;Summary&rdquo; section of Item 17(d), titled &ldquo;Termination by franchisee&rdquo;:</p>

Instead, the prevailing party in any enforcement action is entitled to recover all costs and expenses including attorney's fees. RHODE ISLAND ADDENDUM TO THE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT</p>

<p>As to franchises governed by the Rhode Island Franchise Investment Act, if any of the terms of the Disclosure Document are inconsistent with the terms below, the terms below control.</p>

<p>Item 17.m. of the Disclosure Document is revised to provide:</p>

<p>Section 19-28.1-14 of the Rhode Island Franchise Investment Act prohibits a franchisee to be restricted in choice of jurisdiction or venue. To the extent any such restriction is purported to be required by us, it is void with respect to all franchisees governed under the laws of Rhode Island.</p>

<p>Item 17.w. of the Disclosure Document is revised to provide:</p>

<p>Rhode Island law applies.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON ADDENDUM TO THE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT</p>

<p>As to franchises governed by the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, if any of the terms of the Disclosure Document are inconsistent with the terms below, the terms below control.</p>

<p>In the event of a conflict of laws, the provisions of the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, Chapter 19.100 RCW will prevail.</p>

<p>RCW 19.100.180 may supersede the franchise agreement in your relationship with the franchisor including the areas of termination and renewal of your franchise. There may also be court decisions which may supersede the franchise agreement in your relationship with the franchisor including the areas of termination and renewal of your franchise.</p>

<p>In any arbitration or mediation involving a franchise purchased in Washington, the arbitration or mediation site will be either in the state of Washington, or in a place mutually agreed upon at the time of the arbitration or mediation, or as determined by the arbitrator or mediator at the time of arbitration or mediation. In addition, if litigation is not precluded by the franchise agreement, a franchisee may bring an action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with the sale of franchises, or a violation of the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, in Washington.</p>

<p>A release or waiver of rights executed by a franchisee may not include rights under the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act or any rule or order thereunder except when executed pursuant to a negotiated settlement after the agreement is in effect and where the parties are represented by independent counsel. Provisions such as those which unreasonably restrict or limit the statute of limitations period for claims under the Act, or rights or remedies under the Act such as a right to a jury trial, may not be enforceable.</p>

<p>Transfer fees are collectable to the extent that they reflect the franchisor&rsquo;s reasonable estimated or actual costs in effecting a transfer.</p>

<p>Pursuant to RCW 49.62.020, a noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable against an employee, including an employee of a franchisee, unless the employee&rsquo;s earnings from the party seeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed $100,000 per year (an amount that will be adjusted annually for inflation). In addition, a noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable against an independent contractor of a franchisee under RCW 49.62.030 unless the independent contractor&rsquo;s earnings from the party seeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed $250,000 per year (an amount that will be adjusted annually for inflation). As a result, any provisions contained in the franchise agreement or elsewhere that conflict with these limitations are void and unenforceable in Washington.</p>

<p>RCW 49.62.060 prohibits a franchisor from restricting, restraining, or prohibiting a franchisee from (i) soliciting or hiring any employee of a franchisee of the same franchisor or (ii) soliciting or hiring any employee of the franchisor. As a result, any such provisions contained in the franchise agreement or elsewhere are void and unenforceable in Washington.</p>

<p>A release or waiver of rights signed by the franchisee shall not include rights under the Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act except when executed according to a negotiated settlement after the agreement is in effect and where the parties are represented by independent counsel. Provisions such as those that unreasonably restrict or limit the statute of limitations period for claims under the Act, rights or remedies under the Act such as a right to a jury trial may not be enforceable.</p>

<p>Item 17.r. is modified to also provide that the post-term non-compete will only apply to a 25 mile radius of your Franchised Business.</p>

<p></p>

<p> WISCONSIN ADDENDUM TO THE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT</p>

<p>If the franchise agreement contains any provisions that conflict with the Wisconsin Fair Dealership Law, the provisions of this Addendum shall prevail to the extent of such conflict.</p>

<p>With respect to franchises governed by Wisconsin law, the Wisconsin Fair Dealership Law applies to most, if not all, franchise agreements and prohibits the termination, cancellation, non-renewal or the substantial change of the competitive circumstances of a dealership agreement without good cause. That Law further provides that 90 days&rsquo; prior written notice of a proposed termination, etc. must be given to the dealer. The dealer has 60 days to cure the deficiency and if the deficiency is cured, the notice is void.</p>
