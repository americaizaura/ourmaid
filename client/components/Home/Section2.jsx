              We offer you as a franchisee, a finished, polished and proven
              system to make a decent living from anywhere you heart desires.
              Our Maids Inc. began with the goal of seeking to improve what
              other residential and commercial cleaning services lacked, the
              best customers service, and 24 hours open platform to book your
              service, reschedule it, pay for it, cancel it, do whatever you
              need to do to get your home cleaned at your fingertips any time!
              <br />
              It was the year 2,000 when Antonio V. Moreno, then a business
              student at Amberton University started Our Maids, Inc., in a small
              shop at Arapaho Road, in Richardson, Texas, with a clear vision:
              to create a cleaning service company that can be run from anywhere
              in the world and not tied to a brick and mortar dwelling. To day,
              Our Maids. inc., is the only residential and commercial cleaning
              service company that anybody can run form the palm of your hands!
