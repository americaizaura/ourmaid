              dressed and clean, presentable. Need mask and gloves at any home
              until the COVID is over. We do not discriminate about their
              appearance, they can have piercings, long hair, etc., but our
              customers have the last word. If they do not like their
              appearance, we will not send them back to that particular place.

              Our Maids Franchise, INC., is a Delaware Corporation. Founded by
              Antonio V. Moreno, back in July 4th, 2000, when he was a senior
              student of Business at Amberton University in Garland (Dallas Co.)
              Texas. His Philosophy was simple back then: to be the most
              affordable, detail/oriented cleaning service company in any market
              and to be able to do business anywhere in the world. Unlike the
              grocery store, that is tied to the neighborhood it is located at,
              Our Maids Franchise, Inc. can be anywhere in the world and managed
              from our office in Delaware.&nbsp;

              Today, it still holds true. Many of you who started paying $99
              back then, are still paying the lowest rates in the market. That
              shows, we care about you, appreciate your loyalty. We now service
              5 markets (Delaware and parts of Maryland, Los Angeles, Dallas-Ft.
              Worth and Austin) from our office in Dover, Delaware. With more
              than 22 years of uninterrupted professional, cleaning experience,
              we are still the best value for your money.

            <span>
              To be the most affordable and most reliable cleaning service
              company in any market. We are not just a cleaning company; we are
              an integral part of the communities we service. We were there when
              the child was born and are still there now that she is moving out
              to college and will be there when she is back and hire us to help
              her with the cleaning, as did her parents. We are a people-s
              company.

              franchisees. You will typically register for the next available

            <span>
              Also known as the Tax Identification Number (TIN), Federal
              Employer Identification Number (FEIN) or the Federal Tax
              Identification Number, this is a unique nine-digit number assigned
              for purposes of identification by the Internal Revenue Service
              (IRS) to business entities operating in the United States. When
              the number is used for identification rather than employment tax
              reporting, it is usually referred to as a TIN, and when used for
              the purpose of reporting employment taxes, it is usually referred
              to as an EIN.
            </span>

          <p>
            <span>&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Similar in purpose to the Social Security Number assigned to
              individuals, EINs are used by employers, sole proprietors,
              corporations, partnerships, non-profit organizations, trusts and
              estates, government agencies, certain individuals, and other
              business entities. The IRS uses this number to identify taxpayers
              who are required to file various business tax returns. Individuals
              who are employers may choose to either obtain an EIN or use their
              Social Security Number for the purpose of reporting taxes withheld
              on behalf of their employees.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              An EIN is usually written in the form 00-0000000 whereas a Social
              Security Number is usually written in the form 000-00-0000 in
              order to differentiate between the two.&nbsp;
            </span>
          </p>

            <span>&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              EINs do not expire but they are only numbers given to identify
              businesses. Nonprofit organizations need EINs to apply for an
              exemption from federal income tax. Exemption is terminated if
              annual reports are not filed. To maintain a group exemption
              letter, the central organization must submit an annual report, at
              least 90 days before the close of its annual accounting period.

            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              You should consult with a business attorney, CPA, or tax
              consultant when deciding what business structure is right for
              you.&nbsp;

            <span>
              The actual formal mechanics of creating a corporation is known as
              "incorporation." The process involves completing and filing a
              "Certificate of Incorporation" or "Articles of Incorporation" and
              paying a filing fee. Each state has its own set of laws governing
              the process of incorporating.&nbsp;
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Corporate existence starts when the articles of incorporation are
              filed with the state office that handles incorporations (e.g.,
              usually the Secretary of State or Corporation Commissioner), along
              with the required filing fees. Accelerated incorporations or
              same-day filings are available in some states.

              Choosing a bank account for your small business is an important
              stage in the startup process. There are several key things to
              consider &ndash; such as transaction and borrowing costs, what
              facilities the bank offers, and the type of relationship you want
              from a bank. Here are some suggestions which may help you decide
              which bank would best suit your needs:
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              You must set up a business account if you are starting up as a
              Limited Company, Partnership, or any other key business structure.
              Sole Traders can use their own personal accounts (or via a new
              business account &ndash; John Smith trading as XYZ).
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Do not necessarily choose a business bank simply because you are
              already a personal banking client of that bank. You may feel more
              comfortable with a bank you already know personally, but they may
              not offer the best deal for your business.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Make sure you compare several business bank account offerings, and
              compare the costs and charges associated with each one.&nbsp;
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Naturally, only consider banks that have a strong background
              &ndash; names you will have heard of, or even internet banking
              brands which are owned and operated by the big players.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Bank Charges: A key point to consider is how much it will cost you
              to have a business bank account. You may have a large number of
              monthly transactions to process, for example, so ensure you know
              exactly what charges will be levied on your account before signing
              up. Many major banks provide "free" banking for set periods to new
              businesses, so this may also be of interest.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Online Banking: This is an increasingly important service, and
              most banks now provide an internet service so you can check the
              status of your account day or night. At Our Maids, Inc. this is an
              essential service. Rather than calling the bank to check if a
              payment has been made to your account, you can check online in a
              fraction of the time.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Interest: Although the major banks have improved their interest
              rates on business current accounts in recent years at the request
              of the government, they do vary wildly. Some well-known banks pay
              virtually zero interest on your account balance, but there is
              always a trade-off between free transaction costs and interest
              rates, so consider the overall benefits each account would provide
              to your business.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Small Business Team: Consider a bank which has a specialized small
              business unit. The setup process should be simpler, and dedicated
              teams will be used to dealing with all types of small business and
              their specific needs. Some businesses will require regular contact
              with their bankers, so you should go with a team you feel you can
              build a good personal relationship with.

              professional liability (E&amp;O). Please contact your training

              You may need to register your business on the federal, state,
              county, and city levels of government. On the state level,
              corporations usually register with a particular division of
              corporations, and professions usually register with a business and
              professional regulation department. Most county governments
              require occupational licenses. Many times, it will be necessary to
              obtain a license from your city clerk and then a county license
              from the tax collector. These levels of government and the
              agencies thereof will have various procedures you must follow to
              comply with licensing and permitting requirements for health and
              safety on the business premises, including submission of a floor
              plan. Make certain that your state and county occupational
              licenses are properly displayed. Be certain you understand what
              your occupancy capacity is and stick with it. Many states require
              you to file an annual business report in order to maintain legal
              business status.&nbsp;

              An example: If you are a residential and commercial service
              operation, probable agencies to contact include state
              contractors&rsquo; licensing board, state and county health
              departments, code enforcement, planning and zoning, building
              department, fire marshal, solid waste, motor vehicle, etc. These
              agencies may have toll-free numbers, and most will be part of a
              state or local website. Much of what will govern your operation
              will be written into state statutes.

              However, in this manual entitled Staffing Your Our Maids, Inc.
              franchise outlines the positions that will need to be filled in
              order to open your franchise for business. Finding and keeping
              good personnel is vital to the success of your franchise. Finding
              &ldquo;just the right person&rdquo; may take longer than you
              anticipate, therefore it is imperative you begin interviewing as

          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              When hiring, look for employees that balance your strengths and
              weaknesses. If you are a creative genius but are poorly organized,
              try to attract someone who can bring some
            </span>
            <span>&nbsp;</span>
            <span>order to the company's work.&nbsp;</span>

            <span>&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Remember that what you hire is what you will get in terms of
              personality, strengths, weaknesses, and work style. Good employees
              are found, not changed. You cannot change someone's personal
              attributes. Do not expect to try.

              Start the hiring process by first understanding Our Maids,
              Inc.&rsquo;s Mission, Principles, and Promises. "Who are we?" and
              "What are our values?" Any company must first have an
              understanding of "who" it is before it can know what kind of
              employee it wants to hire. You can help someone learn a skill, but
              you cannot teach attitude. The better the attitude, the better
              service your clients will likely receive.&nbsp;
            </span>
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Employees look for responsibility, a good working environment, a
              sense of accomplishment, a belief in the business and what it does
              and a fair salary. When interviewing prospective employees, ask
              them what they expect to find in the position. Determine what
              skills and attributes are most needed for the job and see if your
              expectations and the applicant's match. If they do, you have a
              good beginning for a productive relationship.&nbsp;

          <p>
            <span>
              If you already have employees, are pleased with them and are
              looking for more like them, ask them to keep their eyes open for
              talented prospects. If you believe you can trust an employee and
              if that employee trusts the prospect, chances are you can trust
              the prospect as well. Many companies offer a special bonus when
              current employees bring in successful hires.&nbsp;
            </span>

            <span>
              The Internet can be a good source for employees, particularly for
              entry-level professional positions. The majority of small
              businesses still use the standard classified advertisement, while
              a growing number are using employee referral programs. Other
              possibilities are through business networks, at job fairs and
              through online job boards.&nbsp;
            </span>

          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Another option, particularly during lean times, is hiring
              independent contractors or outside professionals. Many independent
              contractors can be paid by the job rather than by the hour and
              will help you avoid the cost of benefits. Independent contractors
              are good sources for special expertise for specific jobs.&nbsp;

              The person you select to work for your Our Maids, Inc. franchise
              should have a good reason for wanting to work with you, and it
              should not be just the paycheck. Employees value other benefits
              such as flexible hours, a pleasant atmosphere, quality
              professional development and career potential. Find out what is
              most attractive to your workers about your business and try to
              ensure that you can offer that benefit. It is the best way to
              retain good people.&nbsp;
            </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <span>
              As in any relationship, communication is key. Keep your workers
              informed about what is going on with the company. One of the
              biggest mistakes you can make as an owner/operator is to share
              company information with investors, stockholders, and partners and
              not with employees. Better communication will result in higher
              productivity AND morale.&nbsp;
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Technology can help. Use email, voice mail and instant messaging
              to keep your employees informed. Set weekly or biweekly staff
              meetings to discuss issues in more depth and to offer time for
              feedback and input. Share challenges and successes and invite
              ideas and complaints. Such meetings are particularly critical
              during business start-up. Things change quickly; keep your
              employees informed. Although some employee benefits are very
              expensive, good communication and the sense of belonging to a team
              are free.&nbsp;
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Remember that when someone&mdash;client or employee&mdash;has an
              extremely positive or negative experience with your company, that
              person will tell others about it. Work to keep both groups happy,
              and business will improve. Should problems arise, deal with them
              quickly and decisively. Respond to compliments and resolve
              complaints immediately. Positive word of mouth can be a highly
              effective, yet inexpensive, marketing tool.

              Your professional advisory team should consist of a CPA,
              bookkeeper, and business attorney. You may also want to start
              looking for prospective employees. The need for employees will
              ultimately be a direct function of the demand for your services.
              While some franchisees initially go it alone due to limited
              working capital, others will hire inside/outside sales, service
              technicians, and field workers prior to opening for business. We
              strongly recommend that all franchise locations initially employ
              an office manager who takes calls, schedules appointments, manages
              the books, markets the business, etc. Meanwhile a certified
              service technician or equivalent will perform specified services,
              write reports, etc.&nbsp;

              Please refer to the manufacturer for support with setup and
              installation. We strongly recommend that you purchase the optional
              technical support for hardware/ software. Your time is better
              spent growing your franchise than dealing with the inevitable
              technical problems that arise from time to time.

              Your company will not need to lowball in order to win clients. The
              services you provide will often be a cut above the competition

            <span>
              Staff meeting should become a weekly activity in operating your
              Our Maids, Inc. franchise. Your first staff meeting will in many
              ways set the tone for the ones that follow.&nbsp;
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Here is how to hold a short, effective staff meeting:</span>
          </p>
          <ol className="list-disc">
            <li>
              <span>
                In general, keep them short: Most staff meetings should last
                less than an hour. You want your staff to spend their time
                working on things that earn money for your business, not sitting
                in meetings. Keep them positive. Negative meetings contain
                insults, ridicule, and attacks. These activities create caution
                and resentment, which always costs your company money. Keep them
                interactive. Your staff consists of intelligent people. Put them
                to work in your meetings to advance the effectiveness of your
                organization.

                Share news: Give the members of your group one minute to report
                on progress made in their area of responsibility. You will find
                this results in bullet point reports of essential information.
                It also prevents people from explaining, justifying,
                criticizing, and engaging in other unproductive activities. Plan
                a time budget: 8 to 10 minutes.
              </span>

            <li>
              <span>
                Teach something: Invite a guest expert to give a 10-minute
                presentation on some skill or technology that benefits your
                group. Tell the expert you want a logical explanation of
                practical ideas. You can also ask members of your group to take
                turns delivering brief tutorials on topics that benefit the
                others. Plan a time budget: 10 to 15 minutes.
              </span>

            <li>
              <span>
                Practice skills: Create team learning activities that sharpen or
                teach skills needed in your business. For example, you could
                role-play job skills (especially useful for sales teams), solve
                puzzles (useful for high tech groups), or take quizzes (useful
                for everyone). Ask group members to take turns bringing an
                activity that reviews or teaches a valuable skill. Follow this
                activity with a brief recap of key ideas. Then ask the group
                members to give a 15-second report on how these ideas can be
                applied to improve their work. Plan a time budget: 10 to 20
                minutes.
              </span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>
                Solve problems: Give each group member a minute to describe a
                challenge that hinders work on a current project and then let
                everyone propose solutions. Suggestions should be brief and free
                of self-aggrandizing explanations or motivational sermons. This
                process also requires a positive, supportive environment to
                succeed. If this is used to ridicule, insult, or criticize the
                individual, people will be reluctant to
              </span>
              <span>&nbsp;</span>
              <span>
                reveal issues that need attention. Plan a time budget: 3 to 6
                minutes per person.
              </span>

              <span>
                Use a facilitator: A facilitator will help you conduct meetings
                where the results matter. Then you can participate, rather than
                spend your time managing the meeting. A good facilitator will
                know group decision-making processes that move your meeting
                toward results everyone supports.

              also a necessity for meeting insurance underwriting requirements
              and complying with Our Maids, Inc. standards. The training will
              prepare the prospective franchisee for industry work as well as
              promote efficient business operations. It is the responsibility of
              the franchisee to complete all Our Maids, Inc. training

          <p>
            <span>
              Because each state has special employee regulations, you will need
              to contact your local government agencies for a complete list of
              requirements for your franchise. As the owner/operator, you will
              be responsible for hiring, training, promoting, and dismissing
              employees. To ensure that all aspects of this process are covered
              correctly and legally, pay careful attention to the details
              regarding state and federal employment laws.&nbsp;
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              The first step is to prepare for the actual hiring process. This
              allows your franchise to legally hire employees who are authorized
              to work in the United States. There are several processes you must
              complete before you hire the first employee.&nbsp;

                  File for a Federal Employer Identification Number (Federal
                  Form # SS-4). This sets up the federal income tax process for
                  withholding. You will also be required to set up a payroll
                  deduction account. More information about this process is
                  available at
                </span>

              <span>
                Determine what federal forms you will need (includes the W-4,
                I-9). You will need to establish any similar forms on the state
                level.&nbsp;

            <li>

                Download and print the standard franchise hiring forms. These
                will include the employment application, a consent form for a
                background check, and a form for drug testing (if
                applicable).&nbsp;

            <li>
              <span>
                Determine initial staffing needs. This may be difficult because
                most of your immediate needs will be based on initial demand for
                your product/service. Refer to your business plan forecast for
                accurate planning. Determine the minimum you will need to run
                the office, perform the services, and manage short staffing
                needs due to illness, vacations, etc.&nbsp;

            <li>
              <span>
                Find key staff members first. This includes any management or
                supervisory roles. It is also a good idea to have someone who
                can float across different parts of the business to manage areas
                where you may be shorthanded.

                A few well-placed advertisements will bring applications to you.

              Determining wages or salaries is key to hiring and retaining
              valuable employees. As manager of a franchise, you will quickly
              find that keeping turnover low and maintaining a high level of
              employee morale is vital to your success. You will need to take a
              close survey of what other employers are paying individuals with
              similar skill sets or education levels. Establish competitive
              salary guidelines before advertising any position and relate those
              figures to what you have allocated for your payroll budget.

              Our Maids, Inc.&rsquo;s &ldquo;Quality Standards of Service&rdquo;
              is a key element in our service strategy. A franchisee must
              constantly aim to improve the quality-of-service delivery by
              implementing quality control measures, employee training, and
              ultimately focusing on complete customer satisfaction.

              to know what they should expect from Our Maids, Inc., how services
              will be delivered, what cost they are to the customer and what
              customers can do when services they receive are not acceptable.
              These standards should include:

              family, addressing them by first names when they call and greeting
              them with a smile. We ensure complete satisfaction and often go
              above and beyond the call of duty.

              Developing and implementing service standards helps ensure
              customer satisfaction. Franchise owners and managers must be
              prepared to direct and support their employees.&nbsp;
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              While franchise owner and managers are expected to assume
              responsibility for implementation, all parts of the franchise
              should be involved in carrying out our service standards, and in
              finding solutions to problems discovered as a result of applying
              the standards.&nbsp;

            <span>
              Monitoring is the process of keeping track of customer
              expectations and operational factors and adjusting delivery as
              appropriate. Knowing where customers stand and how they feel about
              quality services should be a key priority. It allows a department
              to modify policies and programs to improve service quality.
              Monitoring shows both customers and employees that the company is
              serious about assessing customer satisfaction to measure its
              performance. Data on customer service and satisfaction show
              employees the results of their efforts and help them focus on the
              essential purpose of the franchise.

            <span>
              Complaints should be handled with professionalism and control.
              Clearly communicating expectations and updating customers on
              progress will go a long way towards avoiding complaints. If a
              mistake is made, quickly address the issue.

              When dealing with an upset customer remember the following items:
            </span>
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc">
            <li>
              <span>
                First try to fully understand the customer&rsquo;s complaint and
                see it from their perspective.
              </span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>If a mistake has been made, apologize immediately.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>
                Communicate how you plan to rectify the situation.&nbsp;
              </span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>
                If the complaint comes from a miscommunication from both
                parties, explain the situation and apologize for your
                part.&nbsp;
              </span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>
                There will be times when a client is simply being unreasonable
                in their request. At this time, you must decide if it is worth
                it to stand your ground. Negative word of mouth can spread fast,
                but you also must be able to recognize customers who are trying
                to take advantage of a situation.

              Office personnel no need dress code. Field operators can or not

              etc., but this is entirely at management discretion. We are not
              using any as of now. They need to be well dressed and clean,
              presentable. Need mask and gloves at any home until the COVID is
              over. We do not discriminate about their appearance, they can have
              piercings, long hair, etc., but our customers have the last word.
              If they do not like their appearance, we will not send them back

            <span>
              Good record keeping is, if nothing else, responsible business. We
              implore you to keep good records in operating your Our Maids, Inc.
              franchise. The following information is general in nature,
              intended to assist you in understanding the nature, importance,
              and process of good record keeping.

            <span>Introduction to Record Keeping</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              An appropriate record-keeping system can determine the survival or
              failure of your new franchise. For those franchisees already in
              business, good record-keeping systems can increase the chances of
              staying in business and the opportunity to earn larger profits.
              Complete records will keep you in touch with your business's
              operations and obligations and help you see problems before they
              occur.

            <span>The Need for Good Records</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Accounting records furnish substantial information about your
              volume of business, such as how present and prior volumes compare,
              the amount of cash versus credit sales, and the level and status
              of accounts receivable. In addition, good accounting records help
              to accomplish the following tasks:
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Monitor Inventory</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              While a large inventory allows goods to be delivered when they are
              ordered, too large an inventory represents an excess investment.
              If your inventory does not turn over quickly, your franchise may
              lose profits due to obsolescence, deterioration, or excess
              investment.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Any items removed from inventory for personal use should be set
              aside in a special account for two reasons: first, they need to be
              recognized separately for tax purposes; second, including these
              items in business gross profit calculations can be misleading.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            <span>Control Expenses</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Accounting records detail the amounts owed to suppliers and other
              creditors so that you can plan the availability of cash to meet
              your obligations. Such records also provide information regarding
              expenditures and allow you to establish controls over them. At all
              times, you must be aware of your individual expense requirements
              and how they relate to the overall picture.

            <span>Fulfill Payroll Requirements</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Payroll is one of the largest expenses in your franchised
              business. Adequate payroll records should meet the requirements of
              the:
            </span>

              For each of these categories you are required to provide annual
              reports and summaries. In addition, you must provide employees
              with the W-2 forms needed to file federal and other income tax
              returns.&nbsp;

            <span>
              Good accounting records will indicate the franchisee&rsquo;s level
              of profit and provide specific information on the profitability of
              certain departments or lines of goods within your business. Such
              analysis is important to avoid continuing product lines beyond
              their profitability. In most cases, you can avoid losses if you
              maintain current records and analyze the information from your
              records on an ongoing basis.

          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Good accounting records provide detailed reports of cash
              availability, both on hand and in the bank, and of cash shortages
              or the diversion of cash. Since cash is your most liquid asset,
              you must carefully account for it.

            <span>Use Supplier Discounts</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              A cash budget will provide the franchise owner with a projection
              of the availability of cash that may be used to pay invoices as
              they become due. Discounts from suppliers for prompt payment can
              amount to substantial savings. A 2 percent discount is common if
              you pay the bill in full within 10 days; if not, full payment is
              due within 30 days. In business, this is commonly referred to as
              "2/10, n/30" where n = the net sum due. It means you pay 2 percent
              less if you pay within 10 days or you pay full price within 30
              days. Take into account that this discount is cumulative. If you
              make timely payments for each month of the year you will gain a 24
              percent benefit (2 percent for 12 months).

          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Finally, good business records help you measure your business's
              performance by comparing your actual results with the figures in
              your budget and those of other similar businesses.

          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Current Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations require that
              you withhold federal income tax and social security (FICA) from
              each employee. You must remit the amount for taxes to the IRS on a
              quarterly, monthly, or more frequent basis. A detailed reporting
              system for payroll will help you make timely tax payments.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Gather specific information about each employee on individual
              employee record cards. All employees should fill out federal Form
              W-4, which indicates their filing status and the number of
              exemptions they claim. Use this information to compute the federal
              withholding and social security (FICA) deductions for each payroll
              check.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Prepare Employees Quarterly Federal Tax Return (Form 941) by
              totaling each employee's withholding for federal taxes and social
              security. File Form 941 with the IRS. Each payroll period totals
              the accumulated withholdings of both federal taxes and social
              security for all employees. If this total exceeds $500 for any
              month, you must deposit this amount by the 15th day of the
              following month in a depository bank (an authorized financial
              institution or a federal reserve bank). Generally, when the total
              exceeds $3,000, you must deposit this amount within three business
              days. Any overpayment in taxes is paid back to you quarterly.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              At year's end, you are required to prepare not only the
              information normally required for that quarter, but also summaries
              of each employee's total earnings and withholdings for the year
              (Form W-2). Provide this form to each employee and the IRS.

            <span>A Word of Caution</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              It is very easy to fall behind in making tax payments. If you find
              yourself short of cash, do not be tempted to delay payment of
              taxes. The IRS will not bill your business for taxes due nor will
              it notify you of late payments. Delayed payments can easily add up
              to a large sum; the debt may impede the growth of your business
              and may even force you to close your business, to say nothing of
              the federal penalties incurred for late payments.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              With a good record-keeping system, you can simplify the process of
              filing taxes to the point where the information needed to complete
              the forms is automatically generated. Setting up such a system is
              a rather technical task, and you may need to seek guidance.

            <span>
              Most franchisees have several types of insurance. For each policy,
              you should have the following information:
            </span>
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc">
            <li>
              <span>Clear statement of the type of coverage</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Names of individuals covered</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Effective dates and expiration date</span>

            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <span>
              Review your insurance policies on a regular basis. In addition,
              annually consult an insurance specialist, who will review the
              total insurance package to determine what coverage is appropriate
              and ensure that premiums remain in line with prior quotations.

              Keep an accurate list of permanent business equipment used on both
              a regular and stand-by basis. The list should describe the
              equipment and provide serial numbers, date of purchase and
              original cost. Keep the list available for insurance and other
              purposes. You will also need this information to prepare accurate
              depreciation schedules.

              You have several choices in who should maintain your accounting

              <span>Hire the accountant who set up your books</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>
                Set up a hybrid system in which you maintain the day-to-day
                reports while an accountant does the period-end record
                preparation, summaries and reconciliations, and the returns for
                sales tax, excise tax and payroll taxes
              </span>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <span>
              In making the choice, you must decide whether you have the ability
              and time to set up and maintain good records or if you should
              engage an outside accounting service. It is usually suggested that
              you hire an accountant to do the final year-end preparations and
              to advise you. No matter what you choose, you should remain
              familiar with your books and participate in the record-keeping
              process. This will maximize the services provided by the
              accountant and allow you to keep track of your business.

              If you decide to hire an outside service, find an accounting firm
              that will work closely with your business and provide you with the
              information necessary to develop a successful operation. Interview
              several accounting professionals and compare their level of
              accounting knowledge, computer literacy, knowledge of and
              experience with small business accounting, and any specialized
              knowledge required in your business.

                Accredited Accountant: An individual who has passed a rigorous
                examination prepared by the Accreditation Council of Accountancy
                and Taxation; a national accounting accreditation board
                affiliated with the National Society of Public Accountants.
                Accredited accountants specialize in small business accounting.

              Other accountants in public practice perform various levels of
              accounting and write-up services. When selecting an accountant,
              the cost of the accountant's fees must be weighed against the
              benefits received. Frequently, the accountant's professional
              advice can increase profits to more than cover the expense.
              Monthly services by an accounting firm will provide you with
              complete and timely information and also will allow the accountant
              to develop knowledge of your business and be in a more comfortable
              position to render professional advice as the business grows.

              In addition to bookkeeping, an accountant can advise you on
              financial management. They can assist with cash flow requirements
              and budget forecasts, business borrowing, choosing a legal
              structure for your business, and preparation and advice on tax
              matters.

              An accountant can help you work out the amount of cash needed to
              operate the business during a certain period for example, a
              three-month, six-month, or one-year projection. The accountant
              considers how much cash you will need to carry your accounts
              receivable, to increase inventory, to cover current invoices, to
              acquire needed equipment and to retire outstanding debts.
              Additionally, the accountant can determine how much cash will come
              from collection of accounts receivable and how much will have to
              be borrowed or provided from other sources. In determining cash
              requirements, the accountant may notice and call attention to
              danger spots, such as accounts that are in arrears or areas of
              excess expenditure.

              An accountant can assist you in compiling the information
              necessary to secure a loan: the assets the business will offer for
              collateral, the present debt obligations, a summary of how the
              money will be used and repayment schedules. Such data show the
              lender the financial condition of the business and your ability to
              repay the loan. Remember, lenders have two very definite
              requirements: (1) that the business have adequate collateral to
              secure the loan and (2) that the business will be able to repay
              the loan. An

              loan. In addition, your accountant may introduce you to a banker
              who knows and respects their financial judgment.

              Franchisee shall at all times maintain true and accurate business
              records in the manner specified by franchisor. Franchisee shall,
              on a weekly basis or at such other intervals as specified by
              franchisor, provide franchisor with such report(s), in the form(s)
              specified by franchisor, as franchisor may require, and at such
              times as franchisor may require, including, but not limited to,
              reports of gross revenues, reports of business expenses and
              overhead, customer information, copies of detailed purchase
              invoices, number and type of transactions, identity of vendors,
              the amount of marketing expenditures, detailed records of
              marketing expenditures, copies of inspection reports, and weekly
              or monthly sales summary. By submitting any reports to franchisor,
              franchisee is certifying that they are true and correct. Within
              ninety (90) days following the end of each calendar year,
              franchisee shall provide franchisor with a copy of franchisee's
              balance sheet and an income and expense statement for the year. At
              the time they are filed, franchisee shall provide franchisor with
              copies of franchisee's federal income tax return(s) and state and
              local excise tax returns, if applicable, together with all
              exhibits and schedules thereto and all amendments thereafter.
              Franchisor is authorized to rely upon such reports and financial
              documents and to disclose them to governmental authorities as and
              if properly requested. Franchisor may use data from the reports
              and financial documents in composite or statistical form for any
              purpose at franchisor's sole discretion. Franchisor is authorized
              to obtain or verify the information and reports described herein
              by electronic means from franchisee's computer(s), at any time,
              without prior notice, at franchisor's sole election. Franchisee
              shall retain all business records for at least five (5) years or
              such longer period of time as may be required by applicable law.

              Royalties and National Marketing Fees for each relevant week and
              effect an electronic funds or other transfer of such funds
              calculated as the greater of (a) franchisee&rsquo;s average weekly
              Royalties and National Marketing Fees over the prior twelve months
              or (b) the average weekly Royalties and National Marketing Fees of
              all similar franchisees within franchisee&rsquo;s region as
              defined by franchisor. Franchisee hereby authorizes
              franchisee&rsquo;s bank to make such transfers upon
              franchisor&rsquo;s request. No action taken under this

              auditing the accuracy of reports submitted and to otherwise verify
              compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Should
              any audit or inspection reveal that franchisee has underreported
              the amount of gross revenues, franchisee shall immediately pay to
              franchisor the additional amount of royalties and other fees
              payable on account of the underreporting, plus interest thereon at
              the rate of one and one-half percent per month, but not more than
              the maximum interest allowed by applicable law. If an audit or
              inspection reveals that franchisee has underreported gross
              revenues by three (3) percent or more for any week, then
              franchisee shall also pay, immediately, the cost of the audit or
              inspection. In all other cases, franchisor shall bear the entire
              cost of the audit or inspection, including incidental costs.
              Should franchisee at any time cause an audit to be made of
              franchisee's licensed business, franchisee shall cause a copy of
              the report of said audit to be delivered to franchisor without any
              cost or expense to franchisor.

              At Our Maids, Inc., an effective marketing program is essential to
              the prosperity of your business. Our business is an
              advertising-driven business, and a large-scale initial campaign
              followed by a selective ongoing and continuous advertising is the
              key to sustaining business and generating new growth. At Our
              Maids, Inc., you will benefit from some level of national brand
              equity, and from certain national or regional marketing and
              advertising efforts. However, many franchises will be required to
              perform marketing and sales activities within local markets of
              operation. For that purpose, we will use this section of the
              manual to communicate ways to build an effective marketing and
              sales plan.

              Marketing is a science and an art form. Companies across all
              industries spend billions of dollars each year to get their
              message out to potential customers who will buy their product or
              service. This is a science, as many statistics are gathered about
              segmenting and targeting potential markets, and the results are
              very carefully measured in hopes of improving the results for the
              next campaign. Marketing is an art form in the way some products
              take off and their appeal spreads like a virus (hence the term
              viral marketing). This type of word-of-mouth advertising is very
              powerful because people are recommending your product to others
              they know. Regardless of what form of marketing program you take
              on, you can be sure to experience a unique set of results that you
              will need to monitor closely. As every marketplace is unique, what
              works for one franchisee may not necessarily work for
              another.&nbsp;

              All Our Maids, Inc. franchisees are responsible for a monthly
              marketing fee. This fee is due at the same time as your Our Maids,
              Inc. royalty fee. This fee is required to be paid in full each
              month by check, pre-authorized check, electronic funds transfer or
              similar. National marketing fees are set at the beginning of each
              fiscal year for Our Maids, Inc. but are subject to change. Our
              Maids, Inc. will communicate any changes 30 days in advance of
              implementation. Marketing fees include the local marketing fees
              which is $2,000 to $3,000 monthly.

            <span>
              Before we can begin to understand how we would like to advertise
              and spend money, we must first understand the local marketplace to
              determine what the current business conditions are in the given
              geographical area where we will be providing service.

          <p>
            <span>
              The franchisee will be required to assess their local market(s)
              and conduct research about other businesses, including their
              services, pricing, and reputation. Understanding your potential
              customers and where they are located is also a priority. It allows
              you to customize local advertising to include certain zip codes or
              target a specific type of customer. The goal of all local market
              research will be to have a simple form that will outline the
              demand by clients and the services being provided by the
              competition. This will help you determine the best pricing for
              services provided by your company. Your market will constantly
              change so this process should be repeated on a consistent basis,
              and this may vary every 30-90 days.&nbsp;

              There are many helpful resources available to assist in
              researching your local market. Books, websites, seminars, classes,
              and work groups can help gather information. Questions to ask
              during the research phase include:&nbsp;

          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Although a marketing plan can be a very complex, multi-faceted set
              of programs and processes, we will take a look at a basic plan to
              fit our business. Most college marketing textbooks start with the
              basics known as the 4 Ps of marketing: product, price, place, and
              promotion. In essence, your plan will focus on executing the
              basics of these four items. Your product is the ability of Our
              Maids, Inc. franchise to effectively serve customers. The price
              you charge for this service is dependent upon the level of
              service, cost, and value the company provides. But price is also
              affected by what your competition will charge. Place refers to the
              area that you want to sell this service: Who will you target? And
              finally, promotion refers to the activities you will use to get
              the word out about your business. While this is a very traditional
              look at what a marketing plan consists of, this formula has been
              proven successful time and time again.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              While keeping the 4Ps in mind, here are the basic steps:&nbsp;
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Collect information: We have already taken a look at the
              importance of understanding the market you will be serving.
            </span>
          </p>
          <ol className="list-disc">
            <li>
              <span>
                Plan the campaign: Now that you understand your market, and the
                service you are selling, how can you use your resources to
                effectively draw customers to my business.
              </span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>
                Implement the campaign: Execution of the plan is often the most
                difficult part of any business, and requires discipline,
                dedication, and a commitment to success. It also requires
                understanding the daily dynamics of success and failure and
                adjusting on the fly.
              </span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>
                Review and assess the results: The proper formula for success
                will be a combination of trial and error with a careful eye on
                good business judgment.

            <span>Planning a Marketing Campaign at Our Maids, Inc.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              We have already discussed the exercise of market research, so let
              us now focus on step 2 in the process: planning the campaign. The
              goal is to understand what forms of media are most effective at
              getting our message out, given we are targeting customers who want
              excellent service. First, we must advertise the excellence of our
              service. Second, we must communicate to the public that we are the
              premier company to meet these needs. One way of looking at
              advertising is through various forms of communications. For
              example:
            </span>
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc">
            <li>
              <span>
                The written medium includes the use of news releases, fact
                sheets, feature articles, newsletters, brochures and handbooks,
                advertising, white papers, and books.&nbsp;
              </span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>
                The spoken medium uses face-to-face discussions, speeches, radio
                newscasts, news conferences, press parties, interviews,
                meetings, and word-of-mouth exchanges.&nbsp;
              </span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>
                The visual medium includes television newscasts and appearances,
                videotapes, motion pictures, slides and filmstrips,
                transparencies, photographs, teleconferences, charts and graphs,
                billboards, and other graphics.&nbsp;
              </span>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <span>
              Another way to examine types of advertising is to take a media
              approach. Marketing and advertising campaigns use media as a
              method of delivering a compelling message about your product or
              service. Types of media:
            </span>
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc">
            <li>
              <span>
                Print: Probably the oldest form of advertising and still very
                effective. Print can consist of direct mail, a magazine ad,
                newspaper ad, posters, flyers, etc.&nbsp;
              </span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>
                Radio: Radio is another form of advertising that has been around
                for many years and is very effective at targeting a specific
                geographic area.&nbsp;
              </span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>
                Television: Most of us think of national broadcast networks or
                cable, but TV can be very effective for regional advertising,
                and can give you the ability to segment your audience by channel
                subject manner.&nbsp;
              </span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>
                Internet/Social Media: This is the newest form of advertising,
                but also the most powerful. Many franchises have elaborate
                websites to display product information and active social media
                accounts to directly engage with customers. They also collect
                data and feedback from customers with which they improve their
                marketing campaigns. Paid web searching through concepts like
                search engine optimization (SEO) or pay-per-click is a powerful
                way to generate leads for your business.
              </span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>
                Billboards: This format will allow you to target many people
                over a given time period in a geography that is very relevant to
                your business.&nbsp;
              </span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>
                Electronic Media: More businesses today are sending out sample
                CDs DVDs and other forms of digital information to advertise
                business and services.
              </span>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <span>
              One of the most important components of a marketing plan is the
              amount of money the franchise will spend, also known as the
              marketing budget. When a new business is started, a marketing
              budget should be allocated from start-up funds and set aside for
              the launch of the business. Starting a business always seems to
              cost more than entrepreneurs project, so it is very important to
              plan what types of media you would like to use, how they differ in
              cost, and a measure of effectiveness (ROI). The start-up marketing
              budget could also include the cost of a &ldquo;Grand
              Opening&rdquo;, which is discussed later in this section.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              While it is a good idea to plan for additional marketing dollars
              at startup, a good rule of thumb is to allow approximately 12-15%
              of your projected first year annual revenue for marketing.
              However, new franchises may have different requirements based on
              your market research.

            <span>Target Marketing</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Now that we have taken a look at forms of advertising, we have to
              analyze our prospective customer base, and overlay the various
              forms of media to determine how we can &ldquo;target market&rdquo;
              with the most effective use of our budget. Throughout the
              operation of your business you will notice several distinct groups
              of customers that typically use Our Maids, Inc. services. In your
              local market research, you will likely encounter a slightly
              different set of customers. Recognizing these different groups
              will allow you to custom tailor your response to best meet their
              needs&nbsp;
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Many companies focus on serving one market very well. As the adage
              goes, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t be everything to everybody&rdquo;.
              There is much truth to this in business. Companies that are able
              to serve a market or niche very well typically find more
              efficiencies over time and become very effective with a given
              customer. Obviously, when building a marketing
            </span>
            <span>&nbsp;</span>
            <span>
              plan, the types of media used will differ depending on your target
              market. For example, advertising in a local business magazine
              would be a great way to lure commercial customers but would not be
              effective for the residential market. And a billboard would not be
              effective for government because all government purchasing goes
              through an open bid process where the low bidder wins.&nbsp;
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              The summary for this section is simple: pick your target market,
              determine what forms of media or what medium is most likely to
              attract that target, and plan a mix of advertising for those
              areas. Like most things in business, you must learn from results
              and adjust your plan over time.&nbsp;

              Advertising can be a powerful medium for both drawing in new
              customers and building brand recognition in your community.
              Although there are many forms of advertising, the mediums
              described below can be very effective, especially for Our Maids,
              Inc. franchisees. Here is a closer look at several formats:&nbsp;

              Each year more and more Our Maids, Inc. leads come from the
              internet, and more and more of our business transactions occur
              over the information superhighway. This trend is expected to
              continue exponentially for quite some time. While demographics
              certainly play a role, you will find customers who prefer to
              search Google instead of leafing through the Yellow Pages. Many
              lower income references come from the internet. Designing an
              effective and highly ranked website is difficult and time
              consuming and for most businesses it is beyond their scope of
              interest and ability. For Our Maids, Inc., the company has already
              invested significant resources to take advantage of the national
              branding. For a franchise this type of support is expected by the
              franchisee. After all, that is one of the values in committing to
              a franchise.

              In many businesses or industries, a web-based advertising program
              is becoming the main focus of marketing funds, and one of the
              primary sources of new leads, accounting for a significant amount
              of all new business generated. Web-related leads have the added
              benefit of producing high sales ratios because customers tend to
              be more informed and educated.

              Our Maids, Inc. promotional director in the corporate offices for

              Check local ordinances regarding banners. Some areas only allow

              not have any governing rules. In the case where banners are not
              allowed, creativity is necessary, such as putting up signs or
              posters inside the windows. The banner rules frequently extend to
              other types of outdoor attention grabbers such as pennants and
              lights.

            <span>Using the Local Press as a Marketing Tool</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Press releases or interviews in a news story are a great example
              of using local press for a very cost-effective form of advertising
              marketing. Because you cannot simply buy your way into a press
              release, you must first present something unique and newsworthy
              about your business. Are you offering a new unique service in the
              area? Are you offering a new product that strikes a chord with a
              segment of the population? Try to put yourself in the shoes of a
              journalist&hellip;what would you find interesting enough about
              your business to showcase it in the local news?
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              But attempting to directly display your services or product are
              unlikely to get your name on the front page of the Sunday
              newspaper. Just because you serve the best food in town hardly
              makes you newsworthy. But if you set up a program where once a
              month you offer free food to local seniors, it may not make the
              front page, but it is certainly newsworthy. The trick is to think
              creatively and be persistent.

              Businesses have been using business cards for decades for a simple
              reason: it is a great way for customers to be reminded of your
              business. Every time you interact with a potential client, be sure
              to hand out your business cards. This method of advertising will
              cost you pennies on the dollar, and it is a great way to establish
              credibility. Any business cards will be the responsibility of the
              franchisee. The franchisor will only be responsible for providing
              company logos and artwork.

          <p>
            <span>
              As we have explained in previous sections, marketing is both an
              art and a science, and there are no perfect solutions or products
              you can buy to magically enable you to reach your sales goals. But
              there are some common mistakes that occur during the
              trial-and-error process that is a result of learning what works.
              Some tips to keep your programs on track include:

                Stick to Your Budget as Best You Can: Spending too much money is
                easy when your means of advertising are not producing tangible
                leads that turn into revenue. Re-think the campaign. Do not
                continue to throw money at a campaign with the idea that more
                money will make it work.&nbsp;

                Spending Too Little Money: Businesses that shy away from
                investing capital in advertising and marketing will never
                receive the proper exposure. Even if you do not see an immediate
                return on your investment from a marketing effort you may see
                long-term benefits when clients know all about your business
                before even having been there.&nbsp;

                Spending Too Much Time: Marketing campaigns can require a
                significant amount of your time. You must constantly evaluate
                the return on your time spent on each campaign. Each hour spent
                on a poor marketing campaign is time lost that could have been
                effectively used elsewhere.&nbsp;

                Impatience: Do not assume that the week after your marketing has
                been set in place your phones will be ringing off the hook. Give
                your campaigns a chance to produce fruit over a period of a
                couple of weeks, and if nothing comes of it then rethink your
                strategy.&nbsp;

                Misinterpreting Results: Do not assume there is a lack of demand
                in a marketplace based on the failure of a marketing effort.
                Make sure that you are utilizing the right tools for the right
                audience. Remember to consult the franchisee section of the
                website for input on effective marketing techniques for your
                specific region.

            <span>
              The last step to consider is assessing the results of your
              campaign. When setting objectives, you should consider a method of
              tracking the results. For example, after launching a campaign
              promoting your business, each time a new customer calls, ask them
              where they heard about your business.
            </span>

            <span>&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              There are several tools that can help decide which techniques are
              working and which are not. These include the Sales Tracker, Phone
              Form, etc. It is impossible to judge the success of any part of
              the advertising program without having numbers to back up your
              assumptions.

              Each type of marketing effort will have different expectations of
              results. Direct mailings for example typically do not have higher
              than a 1-3% conversion rate. Websites, door hangers and other
              types of advertising also have their own unique percentage of
              success. As you perfect your marketing campaign you will begin to
              set a baseline of expectations for each component. This will
              ensure that you direct your efforts to the most effective channels
              possible.

              Without sales, even the greatest are destined for failure. The
              following information is provided as a starting point in the
              development of a successful sales campaign. Each region and
              franchise will require a custom-tailored campaign to achieve the
              most effective results. A significant part of your time and effort

              Usually, these start from engaging with the potential customer to
              finishing the cash wrap: In our concept this is very easy. For
              residential services. You advertise your service online, people
              click on your ad, she is directed to a booking tool, she fills out
              the form and gets a confirmation message, we get the form in the
              office and schedule it. Assign it to the team and send her a
              payment request. She should pay at least an hour before her team
              heads over her place. Sometimes she needs more information and
              calls the office.&nbsp;
            </span>

            <span>
              We answer all or her questions and close the sale most of the time
              in the same call. We have a detailed website where she can find
              all the information, even accurate prices. So, when she sends the
              booking form, she knows exactly what to expect about pricing and
              type of service. We can do a live demonstration with Katie if she
              needs more in-depth knowledge about our concept. For commercial
              service. If it is small (less than 2,000 square feet, we follow
              the same procedure above. If it is big, we set up an appointment
              to see the premises, do a walk through, estimate the hours a team
              of 2 people can take to finish it up, then send a written proposal
              to the prospect.

                from involving claims or litigation.&nbsp;

                Utilize your contracts. Doing business on a handshake in this
                day and age is strongly not recommended. We strongly advise that
                you have a business or contract attorney review each of your
                contracts to insure they are binding per the legal rules and
                regulations in your state. At a minimum your contract should
                identify the client to whom the duty is owed, define the scope
                of the work, define the responsibilities of the client, clearly
                explain the financial remuneration, and explain what constitutes
                the termination of the contract.

                Develop a corporate structure that protects against anticipated
                risks or legal exposure. Understand all assets that need to be
                protected. Seek the assistance of an experienced corporate
                attorney who will help set up your corporation. This includes
                proper insurance products that have been previously discussed.

                Determine the business-worthiness of all clients. Some clients
                are simply not worth the risk. It is recommended that you
                develop a simple screening process or a few questions to
                determine key items like credit risk, safety concerns and
                clients that may pose a liability risk for your employees.

              The following information is presented to Our Maids, Inc.
              franchisees solely as an educational tool to facilitate the
              importance of safety and identify key safety at your location.
              Many states regulate health standards and related safety issues.
              The federal government also regulates employee safety through the
              Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Some aspects
              of your work will fall under OSHA guidelines. Our Maids, Inc. will
              inform you of any changes from the federal government, but it is
              the responsibility of the franchisee to stay informed of the rules
              and regulations that affect your business at the local level.

            <span>
              Most security issues will involve burglary or petty theft of
              company property during off-hours. The potential also exists for
              more serious crime through robbery during business hours or even
              at job sites. Security issues are directly related to safety, so
              the highest effort should be made to adhere to franchise policies
              on security and prevention. Determining smart policies that become
              part of the SOPs is the best way to ensure your franchisees are
              aware of the importance of such policies.

          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              In addition to informing local police and authorities about crime
              or suspicious activity, Our Maids, Inc. requires any incident
              involving company employees, property, or customers and job sites
              be reported immediately after the incident. This may require you
              to place an emergency phone call to the franchise hotline and
              submit the required forms.&nbsp;
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Establishing an emergency hotline is also recommended to advise
              your franchisees during an event that may have adverse effects or
              long-term consequences for the business. You want to give your
              franchisees every opportunity to maintain business continuity.

            <span>
              Before you begin operating your Our Maids, Inc. franchise, you
              will need to form an entity to serve as the operator. An entity is
              a legal fiction that allows a business to take on a separate
              existence, apart from its owners, even though the owners still
              control the business.

              Whatever the business type, you must make sure the name you select
              is not currently used by another business. There are several
              organizations that can help you search. The State Department of
              Revenue or the Secretary of State Offices are good places to
              start. Some states will also have a business license database that
              is searchable. The database can help you determine if the name you
              selected for your business is already taken. Registered names at
              the federal level can be searched via the US Patent and Trademark
              Commission.

            <span>
              After successfully naming your business entity you need to
              determine how to organize the business legally so you can register
              it and apply for the required licenses. What are legal structures
              and what type(s) should you consider? C-corporations,
              S-corporations, limited liability companies, sole proprietorships,
              and partnerships are some of the more common options for business
              legal structures. There are differences and similarities in each
              that can dramatically affect the future of your company. Failing
              to structure your business in the most appropriate way (given your
              goals) can lead to negative outcomes, including higher than
              expected tax payments, excessive administrative work and costs,
              and unexpected loss of your personal assets.&nbsp;

              There are three key issues that differentiate the various types of
              business structures. By understanding these core issues first, you
              will be able to understand the advantages and disadvantages of
              each type of structure.

            <li className="ql-indent-1">
              <span>
                It is not a matter of if you will pay tax, but rather how many
                times you will pay tax. Certain structures are called
                pass-through entities, and income and losses are literally
                passed through from the business to the individual for tax
                purposes. Other structures form a separate tax entity that is
                taxed by itself. Then, when earnings are distributed, the owner
                is taxed again on that income.

              If you drive your car into another car, then you are liable for
              damages. Who is liable for the possible damages and debts incurred
              by your business? It depends on the type of structure. Some
              structures will limit your liability to your investment, others
              will make you and your personal possessions liable for the damages
              and debts of the business.

              You could lose everything you own in your business and in your
              personal possessions. This means your car, your house, your
              personal bank account and more. Your business can incur damages in
              any number of ways. For example, if you end up going bankrupt and
              still have outstanding bills, the creditors will come after your
              personal assets. Also, if a driver for your company accidentally
              kills a pedestrian, your business can become liable. Depending on
              the business structure, your personal possessions may also be at
              risk.

            <span>
              How much time, effort, and money will it cost you to set up and
              run the company? Some structures are very costly in this sense
              while others are relatively low maintenance. While the first two
              issues (taxes and liability) are more important overall,
              administrative costs should not be overlooked. The costs of both
              money and time can be cumbersome, especially for a startup with
              fewer resources. These expenses include tax filing requirements,
              complexity of startup documentation with appropriate agencies
              (i.e. articles of incorporation), and both federal and state laws
              dictating necessary behaviors of the business.

            <span>
              A sole proprietorship is a legal form of business that makes no
              legal distinction between the individual owner and the business
              itself. The owner of a sole proprietorship reports all business
              transactions of the proprietorship on Schedule C of form 1040.
              Income and expenses of the proprietorship retain their character
              when reported by the proprietor. For example, ordinary income of
              the proprietorship is treated as ordinary income when reported by
              the proprietor, and capital gains are treated as capital gain.

              A partnership is an association of two or more persons to carry on
              a trade or business, with each contributing money, property,
              labor, or skill and with all expecting to share in profits and
              losses. For federal income tax purposes, a partnership includes a
              syndicate, group, pool, joint venture, or other unincorporated
              organization through which any business, financial operation, or
              venture is carried on. The entity must not be otherwise classified
              as corporation, trust, or estate.

            <span>
              Partnerships are not subject to income tax. A partnership is
              required to file Form 1065, which reports results of the
              partnership&rsquo;s business activities. Most income and expense
              items are aggregated in computing the net profit of the
              partnership on Form 1065. Any income and expense items that are
              not aggregated in computing the partnership&rsquo;s net income are
              reported separately to the partners. The partnership net profits,
              and separately reported items are allocated to each partner
              according to the partnership&rsquo;s profit-sharing agreement and
              the partners receive separate K-1 schedules from the partnership.
              Schedule K-1 reports each partner&rsquo;s share of the partnership
              net profit and separately reported income and expenses items. Each
              partner reports these items on their own tax return.

                Each partner is responsible for the business dealings of other
                partners. This is very important to understand. If Partner A
                enters into a very bad deal under the name of the partnership,
                then all other partners are responsible for making good under
                that contract. Consequently, selecting your partners is of
                crucial importance.&nbsp;

            <span>
              Similar to a general partnership, but with a separate
              classification of partners. A limited partnership is comprised of
              a general partner and multiple limited partners. Unless special
              rules apply, only the general partners are liable to creditors;
              each limited partner&rsquo;s risk of loss is restricted to their
              equity investment in the entity. Limited partnerships will likely
              be used for real estate development activities, so investors are
              protected against losses in excess of their investment.

              A C-corporation is a legal form of doing business that creates a
              separate legal entity from the individual owners. This legal
              entity can act and do business on its own just as a person would
              (i.e. borrow money, enter into lawsuits and contracts, etc.)

              An S-corporation is a type of corporate legal form that is taxed
              like a sole proprietorship. Its formation is subject to certain
              legal criteria such as a maximum number of shareholders.

                taxes on distributions.

                the papers through the process, there are businesses in your
                state capitol city that specialize in these matters. You will
                receive a federal tax number after filing the federal Employer
                Identification Number (EIN) form. You will need to purchase a

              You will have both a corporate name and a trade name. Your
              corporate name is personal and unique to your particular business,
              while your trade name (also called fictitious name) is specific to
              the company. Your corporate name should not reflect any part of
              the wording of the trade name of the franchise. In most states,
              you may now search an online database to be certain you are not
              duplicating the fictitious name of another business, which may be
              trademarked. Contact your state corporation office by telephone if
              you cannot access an online site. You will fill out a sworn
              statement listing the name to be registered, mailing address of
              the business, name, and address of each owner or, if a
              corporation, the FEIN and state incorporation or registration
              number. Many areas require publication of an ad under the
              fictitious names column in the legal notices area, classified
              advertising section, of your official county newspaper. This is
              your official announcement that you, acting under your corporate
              name, intend to operate a business &lsquo;also known as&rsquo;
              (aka) your trade name.

              The types of federal taxes you will pay may include income,
              federal income tax withholding, Social Security, Medicare, FUTA,
              excise, etc. The Internal Revenue Service can be contacted for
              information on tax matters at 800-829-1040 or online at
              www.irs.gov. The IRS issues a variety of publications and other

              The procedure for acquiring a state tax number is also specific to

              on income, sales, capital gains, unemployment, etc. Contact your
              state revenue office either online or by calling its toll-free
              number. Request any publications available on state tax matters,

              It is highly recommended that you engage the services of an
              attorney for the above procedures, preferably one experienced in
              corporate matters with a specialty in franchising. You should also
              engage the services of an accountant to assist you in setting up
              your corporation for operational and tax efficiency. Your choice
              of an accountant should be based in part on computer software
              compatibility. The costs incurred by engaging these two
              professionals will be more than offset by the advantages gained in
              using their expertise.

              Regardless of whether you will operate the franchised business as
              a sole proprietorship, a general partnership, or an LLC, you must
              file an assumed name certificate with the appropriate governmental
              office. The assumed name certificate is sometimes called a trade
              name certificate, a fictitious business name certificate, or a DBA
              registration. The appropriate governmental office is usually the
              county clerk, but you may be required to file at the state level
              and/or the city level. The purpose of this filing is so that the

            <span>&nbsp;</span>
            <span>
              general public will be informed of the registered agent for a

            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Generally, the required information includes the name of the
              business, the street address of the business, the name of the
              business owner(s), the type of business to be conducted and the
              expected period of operation. The expected period of operation
              should correspond to the initial term of the Franchise Agreement.
              Usually, each owner must sign the certificate and all signatures
              must be notarized. Fees generally range from $10 to $100. In some
              jurisdictions, you will need to place a fictitious name notice in
              a local newspaper for a certain amount of time.

              that the financial output of working together will far exceed that

              each other, always searching for ways to strengthen the bond that
              exists. Complete transparency and open communication are the keys
              to our success.

            <span>
              For most, the initial startup cost of a Our Maids, Inc. franchise
              may seem like a lot of money (we are half less expensive than any
              similar franchise out there.) Do not panic &ndash; here are all
              the stops on the way to getting your Our Maids, Inc. franchise
              financed:

          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Your Personal Resources: Conduct an assessment of your own
              resources before you launch into your search for capital from
              banks or other lending institutions. First, prepare a personal
              financial statement (on a generic form from your bank or an office
              supply store, or by using your personal accounting software). You
              will use it over and over again as you line up your financing.
              Also, make copies of your tax returns for the past two years
              &ndash; both a lender and a franchisor providing financing will
              want to see them. If your Uncle Doug once offered to back you in
              business, give him a call and take him to lunch. Be sure of what
              you can count on &ndash; you cannot afford to go into the business
              with flimsy promises.&nbsp;

              Your Accountant: If you do not have an accountant, it is time to
              get one. Ask for references from friends and family and find an
              experienced one who has handled small businesses (Tip: ask
              existing franchisees in your area for references). Arrange a
              preliminary interview, discuss your plans, and show the accountant
              your personal financial statement, the investment estimates from
              Item 7 of the FDD and any Item 19 earnings claim information in
              the FDD. Talk about how you can calculate a cash-flow picture of
              the business you are planning and how much financing you need. Ask
              the accountant to recommend a banker they have dealt with; usually
              accountants have great leads for their clients.

              The Franchisor: One thing can be said for franchising as a method
              of expanding business: It has developed a tried-and-true path for
              the individual investor. Financing is an important part of that
              path. In about 30 percent of all systems, the franchisor itself
              will provide financing directly or through a third-party lender.
              If this is available from your franchisor, it is laid out fully in
              Item 10 of the FDD. Even if the company does provide financing, it
              is likely to be for only a portion of your total needs.

              The Bank and Specialty Franchise Lenders: It is fair to say every
              small business needs a solid banking relationship. Even if you do
              not find financing at your local bank, you will need to build a
              day-to-day service relationship. The place to start is the bank
              where you do your personal banking. Talk to a banker about your
              plans and explore their programs.

              Though service-based businesses often depend less on patents that
              other types of companies, protecting your trademarks and trade
              secrets still requires diligence.

              Intellectual Property (IP) is a general term for patents,

              individual or business. Protection for IP is granted through the
              issues of patents, licenses, trademarks, etc. For the most part
              there are no issues for franchisees to manage with regard to
              patents, trademarks, or Intellectual Property.

              On March 21, 2022, we filed an application to register the service
              mark &ldquo;Our Maids, Inc. &reg;&rdquo; on the principal register

              from your use of our Names and Marks as long as you are using them
              properly. We may, in this situation, take any action we deem
              appropriate to handle the claim.

              Assignment has been made without franchisor's prior written
              approval. For purposes of this Paragraph 12.01, the terms "Assign"
              or "Assignment" shall include any assignment, transfer, sale or

              limited liability company, and any equity or ownership interest or
              rights in any other form of entity. Any attempted Assignment
              without franchisor's prior written consent shall be void and a
              breach of this agreement.

            <span>
              Notwithstanding the foregoing, if franchisee is an individual,
              franchisee may assign the Franchise Agreement to an entity, as
              defined in Article 11, formed under the laws of the state where
              the licensed business is located, which is wholly owned by
              franchisee; provided that the individual franchisee shall first
              provide written notice of the assignment to franchisor and shall
              personally guarantee the performance of the Franchise Agreement.
              If franchisee is an entity, franchisee may assign the Franchise
              Agreement to another entity, formed under the laws of the state
              where the licensed business is located, of the same or different
              form, which has exactly the same ownership, including percentages
              of ownership as franchisee, provided that each of the individual
              equity or other owners of the new entity shall personally
              guarantee the performance of the agreement. The personal guarantee
              shall be in the form of Exhibit G hereto. No assignment under this
              paragraph shall change or limit the liability of any person or
              entity under the Franchise Agreement. Franchisee shall pay to
              franchisor a processing fee of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for
              an assignment pursuant to this paragraph 12.03.

          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Franchisor may use its own discretion in approving or rejecting
              prospective transferees in the same manner as if it was approving
              or rejecting any other new prospective franchisee, taking into
              consideration such factors as their financial ability, character,
              business reputation, experience and capability to conduct the type
              of business involved. The approval of one Assignment does not
              obligate franchisor to approve any other or subsequent Assignment.
              If franchisee is an entity, notwithstanding any statute or
              agreement to the contrary, the addition, withdrawal or expulsion
              of any equity or other owner or the transfer, encumbrance or
              assignment of any equity or ownership or control interest of any
              equity or other owner or the dissolution or reorganization of the
              entity for any reason is subject to the same considerations as any
              other Assignment.

              There shall be no restriction upon franchisor's right to encumber,
              transfer or assign the Franchise Agreement or the system.
              Following such a transfer or assignment, franchisor shall have no
              further obligation or liability to franchisee hereunder or
              otherwise so long as the assignee or transferee agrees to assume
              all of franchisor&rsquo;s liabilities and obligations to
              franchisee. Upon franchisor&rsquo;s request, franchisee shall
              execute and deliver a certificate to franchisor, as described in
              Paragraph 21.05, in connection with an anticipated transfer or
              financing procedure by franchisor. Franchisee agrees to accept any
              transferee of franchisor, including any sub franchisor and perform
              for such transferee the same as for franchisor.
